  <p>You have an idea for a software project. You’ve noticed an opportunity to create a new tool or platform that will help you increase customer engagement and reach new markets. But once you have a goal in mind, you have to walk through a minefield to get there. Two out of three software projects don&#8217;t succeed<sup><a href="http://www.iag.biz/images/resources/iag%20business%20analysis%20benchmark%20-%20full%20report.pdf" target="_blank">1</a></sup>. How can you avoid a similar fate?</p>

<h2>You Need The Right Help.</h2>

<p>You have to decide how you are going to build this thing. And you have to decide who is going to do it.  If you happen to be a technical company that has plenty of engineers with the skill set you need to deliver, and they have the time, and you can afford the additional resources,  then you are set. But what if you don’t have a specialist in-house?</p>

<p>You could <strong>hire someone,</strong> but hiring is expensive and time-consuming. If you have technical expertise, you can vet developers, but if you don’t, how can you be sure you won’t hire a dud?  Then once you find someone, there’s healthcare, equipment, scheduling, taxes, and a whole mess of overhead. You have enough headaches as it is and don’t need to add all of this on to your plate.</p>

<p>You could <strong>outsource the work overseas,</strong> But this is highly risky. It’s cheap, sure, but you end up working with people using a different language on a different time table.  Projects live and die on communication.</p>

<p>You could <strong>hire a large agency</strong>, and pay for a lot of overhead. Working with large agencies is like riding an elephant to work: It’ll get you there eventually, but it’ll move slow and probably have left a lot of unexpected expenses in its path.</p>

<p>So, you need someone that can deliver … while reducing complexity in your business instead of increasing it.</p>

<p>You need someone that understands you and your business … and can answer emails in timely fashion.</p>

<p>You need someone that has the reliability of a large company … but the nimbleness of a small one.</p>

<p>Hi, I&#8217;m Glenn! and &#8230;</p>

<h2>I’m 100% Focused on Your Project’s Success</h2>

<p>I’ve  built my services from the ground up, aimed at helping my you achieve your objectives. I’ve worked in the industry for seven years and seen my share  (and been a part of) of failed software projects. Why do so many projects fail?</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Lack of knowledge.</strong> Developers don’t know what they are building … or more importantly  <em>why</em> they are building it.</li>
<li><strong>Going over time and budget</strong>.  If you don’t know what you are doing, how can you plan effectively? Answer: You can’t.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of constraints.</strong> There’s always <em>one more thing</em> to do,  and you can kill a project by over-watering it with feature ideas.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of direction.</strong> Every week the team sprints in every direction but <em>forward</em>. After enough iterations through the deserts, projects die of dehydration.</li>
</ul>


<p>All of these share a common cause.</p>

<h2>Fear.</h2>

<ul>
<li>People <strong>fear</strong> the unknown,  so they avoid it entirely.</li>
<li>People <strong>fear</strong> loss, so they can’t make the hard decisions that help their project.</li>
<li>People <strong>fear</strong> criticism, so they don’t talk to their customers enough.</li>
<li>People <strong>fear</strong> failure, so they push back the launch until it’s “perfect” .</li>
</ul>


<p>So how do you beat the fear? Hard work and research. It&#8217;s not sexy, but it works.</p>

<h2>But Aren’t You Just Some Coder?</h2>

<p>I’ve written a lot of code. If we work together, I’ll write some more. But I’ll let you in on a little secret.</p>

<p>The code is the <strong>least</strong> important part of a software project.</p>

<p>I know, it sounds weird, but let me explain.
 Software is <em>communication.</em> It’s communication between the people who own it, the people who built it, and the people you use it. My goal isn’t to only build the tool, but to teach you and your customers how to be better <em>through</em> the tool.</p>

<p>I don’t work with clients unless I’m sure my work is going to have an impact. I figure out your goals, how we’ll measure success, then do research and planning to find the most effective way to get from where you are to where you want to be.</p>

<p>I plan on being an investment, not an expense.</p>

<p>Then I’ll get into the “coding stuff”.</p>

As a result, I rely on him daily to deliver practical solutions for our clients and work server side magic for my front end designs.  I learn something every time we talk!&#8221;</p><footer><strong>Zach Alig</strong> <cite>Designer for Proof Industries</cite></footer></blockquote>


<h2>So How Do I Know You’ll Be On Time and Within Budget?</h2>

<p>The most dangerous part of web development tools and “agile” project management practices available these days is that they let people start working before they know what the hell they are doing.</p>

<p>Before we work together, we&#8217;ll talk about the goals you are trying to achieve and how we’ll measure the success of the project. Once we’ve done that we’ll agree on a fee that works for both of us. You know exactly what to expect at a certain price. No timesheets.  This means your project is <strong>100%  guaranteed</strong> to stay within budget.  Heck, I wrote the book on it.<sup><a href="/books/project-estimation-guide" target="_blank">2</a></sup></p>

<blockquote><p><img class="testimonial-headshot" src="/images/case_studies/jill.jpg"><br/>We needed a strong Angular specialist with a focus on test-supported code to help our in-house team. Glenn was able to step in and translate complex requirements into a seamless interface for us.</p><footer><strong>Jill Adams</strong> <cite>Senior Project Manager</cite></footer></blockquote>


<h2>Then What?</h2>

<p>Building software is just step one. Once we reach the goal of an initial project, we can go down a few paths.</p>

<ul>
<li>All of my work comes with e <strong>30-day guarantee.</strong> If a defect slipped through all of the automated testing and user acceptance, I’ll fix it.</li>
<li>When this project is done,  I can provide <strong>training</strong> to make sure you know how to get the most out of your product.</li>
<li>and if you want to learn continually and grow your business, we can work out a fixed <strong>monthly retainer</strong> including monthly meetings, priority phone and email support, and on-going, growth-driven development.</li>
<li>Or maybe we do another a <strong>one-off project</strong>. A project is a set of defined work with an objective; One piece of software can involve many projects.</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p><img class="testimonial-headshot" src="/images/case_studies/chris.jpg"><br/>Glenn understands my evolving business development needs, and has more than once provided helpful consultation related to marketing and customer discovery, pricing, and competitor analysis. In his consultations, I have found in him a trusted partner, and someone who&#8217;s made my life as a CEO easier.</p><footer><strong>Chris Bell</strong> <cite>CEO of Wagglez</cite></footer></blockquote>
