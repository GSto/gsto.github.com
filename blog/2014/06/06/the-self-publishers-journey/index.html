<p>I&#8217;m working on self publishing and eBook in the coming months, and I wanted to document my journey and share it with you. I have enjoyed and been inspired by other writings such as <a href="http://groovehq.com/blog">Alex Turnbull documenting his ongoing journey to get to $100,000 recurring revenue</a>, and Nathan Barry&#8217;s <a href="http://nathanbarry.com/category/the-web-app-challenge/">&#8220;Web App in Six Months Challenge&#8221;</a>. There is nothing like publicly sharing your techniques and struggles in order to both share useful information with other people, and to keep myself accountable.</p>

<h3>The Story So Far</h3>

<p>I think a lot of freelancers dream of finding ways to make money besides charging for their time. It could be by setting up recurring revenue, productizing their consulting services, or building a product they can sell individually. I decided to try what many before me have, and build a product. Heck, there is an <a href="http://chasingproduct.com">entire podcast</a> dedicated to the subject (which is really good, by the way).</p>

<p>Being a web developer, of course my first thought was to build some form of SaaS application. Enough reading on the internet scared me off of that idea (for now): SaaS applications on average take two years before they bring in enough income to stand on their own, and I know from experience they can take months to develop. I had started a couple of ideas, but could never find the time to finish them. Then I found an article by Amy Hoy called <a href="http://unicornfree.com/2013/why-you-should-do-a-tiny-product-first">&#8220;Why you should build a tiny product first&#8221;</a> and it really resonated with me. It got me thinking about products that I could complete in 90 days or less. I liked writing, and based on several freelance sites I had read before, I knew that there was a lot of interest in starting to freelance, but a lot of people didn&#8217;t know where to begin.</p>

<p>The tiny idea was also appealing because it would be a straight up easier way to launch a product. I have worked with enough small businesses and start-ups to know that launching a new business or product is <strong>hard</strong>. Really, REALLY hard. There is no reason to tackle new business ventures on hard mode, and I feel that if there is anything you can do to make things easier on yourself, you should do it. And it is much easier to write a book than build a piece of software, and it is a lot easier to convince someone to pay you $29 once instead of $29/month indefinitely.</p>

<h3>The Freelance Start-up Guide</h3>

<p>It was at this point, around the start of this year,  I decided to work on a book, then titled <strong>The Freelance Start-up Guide</strong>. It was going to be aimed at aspiring freelancers, and help them build a product from scratch. I started writing the book, and set up a mailing list. Initial response was a bit tepid on the mailing list, but there was some interest in the idea.</p>

<h3>The First Big Hurdle</h3>

<p>Around the start of February, I had a huge rush of client work, admittedly, more than I could handle. I knew something had to give, and I informed my tiny mailing list that I had shelved the project indefinitely. I knew at that time that I did not have any extra bandwidth, and had to cut work where ever I could.</p>

<h3>The Real Tiniest Product</h3>

<p>About a month ago, I decided to give building a mailing list a second try. I figured that I could build an audience before I built the product. Even if I didn&#8217;t finish that book, I would still have an audience, and that had value. I signed up for Nathan Barry&#8217;s <a href="http://www.convertkit.com">ConvertKit</a>, and during his ConvertKit academy, he gave me a valuable piece of advice: You can get a lot more email list subscriptions if you give users an incentive for signing up. I compiled some of my past blog articles, wrote some new content, and released <em><a href="http://glennstovall.com/books/freelance-pricing-handbook/">The Freelance Pricing Handbook</a></em>. This is a small, 32 page eBook that I gave away for free. I was able to grow my list from 15 to 100 subscribers overnight. You can read my case study on it&#8217;s release here.</p>

<p>This so far has been the best move I&#8217;ve made. I always liked blogging, but it had been directionless before. Now instead of people reading my article, and that bringing me no value, I could capture readers and have a way to continue engaging with them. This meant that every post I had written in the past and every post I would write in the future was more valuable. Now they weren&#8217;t just articles, they were sales tools.</p>

<h3>Version 2.0: Bootstrap Freelance</h3>

<p>Now it&#8217;s June, and my client work has returned to levels where I don&#8217;t feel completely underwater. I decided that I wanted to pick up the project and continue working on it. At this point, I had almost 65 pages written, and an email list with a couple of hundred people on it, and I didn&#8217;t want to throw all of this away. I renamed the product <em>Bootstrap Freelance</em> and decided to pick the project back up. I decided that instead of just telling people how to get their first client, I wanted to add more content based on lessons I had learned on how to build up their business after that. I&#8217;m nervous about announcing a launch date based on what happened last time, but I am shooting for a release date sometime in August.</p>

<h3>&#8230;And Here We Are</h3>

<p>Now I have roughly 80 pages of a first draft, which is about 2/3rds of what I want it to be. I am working on spending more time working not only on the book, but on marketing before that. For example, setting up a landing page for the product, and starting to public write about the progress of the book. I plan on updating this blog with information about the process, along with helpful information from the book. I am also going to send updates every single Friday to anyone who wants to help me accountable. If you&#8217;d like to keep up with the progress on the book, enter your email address below:</p>
