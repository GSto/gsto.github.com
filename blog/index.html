  <div class="entry-content" style='display:none;'><p>One part of the freelancing puzzle I haven’t solved yet is keeping revenue stable. Here’s a lifetime graph of my revenue, month, by month:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/articles/lifetime_revenue.png"></p>

<p>There’s a lot of peaks and valleys.  Good clients,  bad clients, late payments, upfront payments. Sales slumps. Family emergencies. It’s all there.</p>

<p>About a year after I became a freelancer, I started another exciting venture in my life: marriage. Once we got back from our honeymoon, we had to start dealing with one of the mundane parts of marriage:  Money. Merging finances and budgeting for the future.</p>

<p>Budgeting is hard when you have a reliable salary. Planning on variable income seemed impossible. The first year I was married I brought home $0 - $10k+ per month. How could I decide how much I could dedicate towards groceries?</p>

<p>I was also riding the rollercoaster emotionally. I’d feel great on good months, and stressed on others. It was hard for me and my family.</p>

<p>There are ways to balance these peaks and valleys that I’ve implemented since then: Better billing practices, selling monthly retainers and <a href="glennstovall.com/books/project-estimation-guide">launching products</a>. These changes take time, and you don’t have to change your business to get a handle on your finances.</p>

<h2>Smoothing Out The Edges</h2>

<p>I needed to get a better handle on money.  I decided to set up a system that would help me manage my dollars and set me up for future success. As I wrote about in my article on <a href="glennstovall.com/books/project-estimation-guide">risk</a>, standing on shaky financial ground means you are unable to pursue options that have more risk or didn’t pay off in the short-term.</p>

<p>This is that system.</p>

<p>It’s a bit jarring to make the switch, but if you do you can live a more balanced life and build a stronger foundation for your business.</p>

<h2>1: Separate Business and Personal Bank Accounts</h2>

<p>I’m a programmer; I’m pretty big on decoupling. Decouple means to take two things that shouldn’t be combined and separating them. This way bugs break one thing instead of not ten.  The first step is to set up a business checking and savings account. You can set one up as an LLC, S-Corp, or sole proprietor. This way you&#8217;ve decoupled your business finances from your personal, which will help you decouple <em>revenue</em> from <em>income</em>.</p>

<p>The savings account is for your tax payments. I’m not an accountant, but I strongly recommend setting aside a percentage of every payment you receive so that you don’t get caught with a huge tax bill at the end of the year.  The amount will depend on your revenue, expenses, and state, but it’s usually falls in the 15% - 35% range.</p>

<p>Talk to a professional accountant if you have tax questions. Accountants can easily have a 10x return on what you pay them.</p>

<p>Now, all of my revenue doesn’t go to me; it goes to my business.</p>

<h2>2: Figure Out Your Monthly Nut</h2>

<p>Stop snickering.</p>

<p>Your monthly nut is a fixed amount that you need to cover your expenses. You want to calculate your fixed expenses and any fixed amount for any debts or savings.  Any annual expenses should be divided by 12 and factored into each month.</p>

<p>If you aren’t sure about expenses, it’s better to guess high than low. If you underestimate on your power bill, it could be a financial stress. Too high, and you can an extra sandwich this month.</p>

<h2>3. Figure Out Your Salary</h2>

<p>Now it’s time to figure out how much to take from the business each month.  Your monthly salary should be your expenses + enough to be comfortable. It’s a personal decision. You don’t have to be a miser, but lavish spending will defeat the whole point of the exercise. Leave yourself some fun money.</p>

<p>Once you’ve calculated, you’ll know the <em>fixed amount</em>  that you will transfer from your business account to your personal account. That&#8217;s your salary, and it is unaffected by that month&#8217;s revenue.</p>

<p>Your business now has a payroll with one employee. As a business owner, you have a clear idea of how much money you <em>need</em> to make each month, and as a human you know what to expect.</p>

<h2>4. Making The Switch</h2>

<p>It can be hard to make the switch from living invoice-to-invoice over to a salary. You might not be able to make the switch just yet. It’s easiest when you are having a better month. If you can’t switch just yet, put whatever percentage you can afford towards your business checking account. Even if it is just 10%, it&#8217;ll help you start to make the switch.</p>

<p>When I first started, I paid myself every Friday. Doing payroll in shorter intervals can help you make the transition. Now I pay myself on the first of every month.</p>

<p>The psychological benefit is <strong>huge</strong>. I cash my paycheck, which I physically write and scan with an app because I’ll be <em>damned</em> if I’m paying $10/month for direct deposit. Once that hits the bank, I know I’m covered for the month and don’t have to worry.</p>

<h2>5. Build Your Runway</h2>

<p>As your business starts to better with its calmer, focused CEO at the helm, you may find you are building a stockpile. You now have a new and more fun problem:</p>

<p><strong>What do I do with all this extra cash?</strong></p>

<p>You have a few options. If it’s consistent, and you have other personal needs or goals, you could give yourself a raise or a bonus. The goal is long-term growth, but there is nothing wrong with rewarding yourself for good work from time-to-time.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/articles/treat_yo_self.gif"></p>

<p>The option I prefer to is to start building <strong>runway.</strong> The runway is the number of months your business can keep going.  Most of us work on a perilously short one.</p>

<p>I have a payroll target to hit. I need a certain amount of available funds after business expenses to make payroll on the first.  When I first made the switch I had months, I didn’t make payroll until the 27th. But as I worked and saved, the gap got wider and wider.</p>

<p>Now, it’s Mid-September, and I’ve already made payroll for the year. I can sleep easy even if I don’t bring in another buck.</p>

<p>Longer runways lead to higher and further flights. Once you have a runway, you can take the time to learn new skills, target new markets, and build new products; and you can do it without fear.</p>

<p>So think about this, and let me know in the comments, If you had six months of runway, what would that mean for you and your business?</p>

  <div class="entry-content" style='display:none;'><p>People have probably told you that two things every business should be doing is generating content and building a list. The problem with this advice is that it usually comes wit no “how” or a “why”. Writing content as a marketing strategy is a slow burn with abstract benefits. But a solid strategy can bring in more customers, help you build relationships, and help you position yourself as an expert to others. And writing content that does this is not as hard as it looks.</p>

<p>One of the scary factors of creating a content strategy is that publishing consistently is valuable, but that requires a commitment. When you don&#8217;t know <em>what</em> to write about, <em>how</em> to write about it, or how to get readers, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed. Here’s my 9-step process I use to generate content; A Roadmap you can use to start mapping out your content strategy.</p>

<h2>1. Keep A Swipe File</h2>

<p>If you are solving people&#8217;s problems with your work, then you have more than enough jumping off points for pieces of content. Content is providing value at scale. If you are providing content in a one-to-one or one-to-few manner, you can turn that into content to provide that value to potential customers on the internet.</p>

<p>To keep track of these events, I keep a <em>swipe file</em>. My swipe file is a collection of thoughts, notes, and links that could become articles one day. Here are my sources for potential content ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Interesting Conversations.</strong> Did you have an interesting discussion that relates to your business with someone in a sales meeting or even just at the bar? Put it in the swipe file.</li>
<li><strong>Problems You Solved.</strong> Did you solve any interesting problems this week? Put a note in the swipe file. These notes are the source of my technical articles.</li>
<li><strong>Email.</strong> Did you write a good email response to someone or have an interesting discussion? Put it in the swipe file.</li>
<li><strong>Forums and Social Media.</strong> Did you write a good response to someone or have an interesting conversation on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, or some other forum? Put it in the swipe file.</li>
</ul>


<p>You’ll see from above the easiest way to build content is to <em>have conversations.</em> Writing content is just a one-to-many way to build relationships, so any one-to-one conversation you have is a solid jumping off point.</p>

<h2>2. Make Writing A Habit</h2>

<p>Nathan Barry talks about how the biggest difference maker in his business was <a href="http://nathanbarry.com/commitment-changed-career/">making a commitment to writing 1,000 words a day</a>. If you want to produce a lot of quality content, you need to make it a habit. Make time every day, even if it is only 15 minutes. If you don’t know where to start, that’s why you have a  swipe file. Open it and pick one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>The note in the swipe file that excites you the most.</li>
<li>If nothing is exciting to you, then just grab the oldest one.</li>
</ul>


<p>Another benefit to a consistent habit is that you can work on ideas while they are still fresh and exciting. If you write an idea and don’t flesh out the idea until six weeks later, you might find that your interest in that topic has waned.</p>

<p>The emotions you feel when you write will transfer over to the people reading it. Bored writers write boring content.</p>

<h2>3. Outline and Brainstorm</h2>

<p>Before you start hammering away at the keys, take a few minutes and figure out what it is you want to say. Sketch out the key points you want to hit and what you want to say about them. Having some idea of where you are going will make steps 4 &amp; 5 a lot easier and more efficient. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map">Mind mapping</a> can be useful here.</p>

<h2>4. Choose A Template</h2>

<p>Good content has structure, and you don’t need to reinvent the wheel every time you sit down to write. Songs have a verse-chorus-verse structure that can be repeated infinitely without losing people’s interest. In fact, following a pre-defined formula makes the content <em>more</em> accessible to the reader.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Pain, Dream, Fix.</strong> I got this one from <a href="https://unicornfree.com/2013/how-i-increased-conversion-2-4x-with-better-copywriting">Amy Hoy</a>. Talk about the problem, and then talk about how great things would be if your reader didn’t have that problem, then talk about how they can solve that problem. The pain you an engaging starting point.</li>
<li><strong>Lists.</strong> They can be cheesy, but the internet loves lists. If your content makes sense in a sequential order, then consider taking that approach.</li>
<li><strong>Stories.</strong> If you want to take a more entertainment based route, you can tell stories. Each story has a protagonist (either you or the reader), a conflict, and how they overcame that conflict.</li>
<li><strong>Comparisons.</strong> Write about ‘this vs. that’ and compare and contrast two products or opposing viewpoints.</li>
<li><strong>Essays.</strong> An essay starts with a thesis, then provides evidence to back up that thesis. Paul Graham is a master of this.</li>
<li><strong>Tutorials.</strong> Write a ‘how to X’ article. These are the easiest to write for me. Most of my tutorials are for my benefit.  If I run into a previously solved problem, then I can quickly reference what I wrote previously.</li>
<li><strong>Roundups.</strong> A Roundup is a collection of resources from other places online. This template is useful if you don’t have a lot to say on a subject but want to get something out there.</li>
</ul>


<h2>5. Write A Terrible First Draft</h2>

<p>You should have a clear vision of what you want to say, and how you are going to say it. Now it’s time to get to work. The main goal of your first draft is you put words on paper. The best way to this is to remember to do one thing:</p>

<p><strong>Give yourself permission to suck.</strong></p>

<p>Just write. Don’t edit. Don’t worry about filling in links or notes. If you need to find links or do research to back up your points, leave yourself notes to do that later. The most important thing here is that you are getting words down.</p>

<h2>6. Edit</h2>

<p>I like to give an article some breathing room, so I don’t write an article and publish it on the same day. When you are building a writing habit, you may consider have 2 - 3 writing days and 1 - 2 editing days.</p>

<p>No one produces something great on the first try. That’s why we don’t even attempt it with our terrible first draft. Now it’s time to take the marble slab of our terrible draft and carve out our traffic generating Statue of David.</p>

<p>When editing, we want to keep a few different people in mind.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Edit for your readers.</strong> Read your content, fill in any blanks, and do any ‘TODOs’ you left yourself. Remember when I said you didn’t have to find research links or fill in every section earlier? Time to take care of that.</li>
<li><strong>Edit for your haters.</strong> The internet is not always the nicest place. If you make an assertion, you need to back it up. One unclear or unsubstantiated claim is enough for someone to not give your entire piece any merit.</li>
<li><strong>Edit for your English Teacher.</strong> If there is another thing the internet doesn’t take kindly to, it’s spelling and grammatical errors. These can hurt your authority. I’d recommend reading Strunk &amp; White’s Elements of Style, and using <a href="http://glennstovall.com/recommends/grammarly">Grammarly</a> to automate the process.</li>
</ul>


<h2>7. Optimize</h2>

<p>When Optimizing we focus on the beginning and end of your article. The beginning is your headline, and the end is your call-to-action. These will be the artisan bread that accents the meat and toppings of your delicious content sandwich</p>

<p>The headlines j is to get people to read the rest of your article. Much like the structure of the article, it’s nice to have some templates in place for this. Here are a few I learned from CopyHackers that I use:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Timed premise:</strong> “How to Make A Delicious Sandwich in under 15 minutes.”</li>
<li><strong>Even If:</strong> “How to Make Delicious Sandwiches Even If You Can’t Afford Top-Shelf Ingredients.”</li>
<li><strong>How-To:</strong> “How to Make a Delicious Prosciutto Sandwich”.</li>
<li><strong>Quantity:</strong> “Make 100 Sandwiches Instead of Hiring A Caterer.”</li>
<li><strong>Lists:</strong> “35 Unlikely Sandwich Combinations.”</li>
<li><strong>Why:</strong> “Why You Should Be Eating Peanut Butter Banana Bacon Sandwiches.”</li>
<li><strong>Ultimate:</strong> “The Complete Sandwich Playbook.”</li>
<li><strong>Simile:</strong> “Make Sandwiches Like Alton Brown.”</li>
</ul>


<p>Remember that your headline needs to engage the reader and leave them wanting more. It should spark emotion and curiosity. Try writing a couple and coming up with the best one. It’s also important to note that you don’t want to over-optimize your headlines. Don’t be Upworthy. If your headline is salacious and your content doesn’t deliver, you will leave your potential customers feeling disappointed, frustrated, and lied to.</p>

<p>The call-to-action is what you want readers to do after reading the article. Your CTA doesn’t have to be a hard sell, nor should it be. You want to focus on engaging with the reader further. Here are some ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ask a question and ask people to respond by commenting.</li>
<li>Ask people to join your mailing list.</li>
<li>Offer people a lead magnet or bonus benefit, which is just another way to get them on your mailing list.</li>
<li>Ask people to email you or fill out your contact form.</li>
<li>Ask them to follow up with more information, like a survey.</li>
</ul>


<p>If you have a product, you can include a call to action here, but it depends on what you are selling. I prefer to get people to opt-in to further engagement where I can continue to interact with them and build trust, and try to make the sale later. The important thing is that without a call-to-action, your content is not going to be doing as much work as it should for you.</p>

<h2>8. Publish</h2>

<p>Content sitting in your notebook or on your hard drive isn’t going to do you any good. You have to get that content out there. It doesn’t matter what tools you use, just pick one and go with it. For your content, Your mailing list, WordPress, or SquareSpace are all fine outlets to use.</p>

<p>I’d recommend publishing as regularly if you can. Once a week is ideal; It doesn’t take a huge commitment, and if you are writing every day then having at least one good piece of content per week should be attainable. However, while consistency is important, I favor missing a week over putting out sub-par content.</p>

<h2>9. Publish Again</h2>

<p>You can use content more than once. Here are the publishing channels I put my content on, in order of preference:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://glennstovall.com/">My Personal Site</a></li>
<li><a href="http://glennstovall.com/letters/">My Mailing List</a></li>
<li><a href="medium.com/@gsto">Medium</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/today/author/36107098">LinkedIn Blog</a></li>
</ul>


<p>I space these out over a couple of weeks for each article. Also, every article doesn’t go on every platform; I only publish it when it makes sense. I mentioned earlier how publishing consistently helps you build a following and your expertise. When you can publish each piece of content up to four times instead of just one, publishing content consistently becomes much easier. You get a chance to get in front of more eyeballs and further grow your audience.</p>

<p>If you still aren&#8217;t sure how to start generating content, or why you should do it, leave a question in the comments.</p>

  <div class="entry-content" style='display:none;'><p>All businesses are inherently risky. Human beings are <em>terrible</em>  at understanding and quantifying risk. Since most entrepreneurs tend to be human beings, this causes problems. Without having a clear picture of what risk is, how to identify it, and how to quantify it, making correct decisions about your business can be hard.</p>

<p>The biggest cognitive dissonance is that people confuse variance and risk. For the purposes of this article, I am defining variance as the variety and difference and outcomes of any given probabilistic event. A six-sided die has more variance than a coin since it has six different possible outcomes while a coin has two.</p>

<p>We define risk as the losses incurred based on the outcomes of one of those events. The greater the amount of loss and the greater the chances of that loss occurring increase the amount of risk in any decision.</p>

  <div class="entry-content" style='display:none;'><p>Launching a new product can induce a lot of anxiety. If you have been working on your product for some time, it is easy to let the fear of uncertainty about public reaction take over. You might decide to push the launch the back until you can one feature a bit better, a part of the design a bit cleaner, or to fix one more outstanding bug. You end up pushing your launch back to next week, next month, or in the worst case, “one day”.</p>

<ul>
<li>What went well?</li>
<li>What went wrong?</li>
<li>What steps should I take in the future?</li>

  <div class="entry-content" style='display:none;'><h3>And 5 Tips to Improve Each One</h3>

<p>The end of the year will be here soon. It&#8217;s a time to reflect on how the past year went, and plan for the next year. There are three numbers that are the determining factors for your bottom line. By understanding these numbers, you will know what metrics you need to move in order to get the business results you want. By doubling just one of three numbers, you&#8217;ll double you revenue, without doubling your workload. So instead of saying &#8220;I want to make more money next year&#8221;, by the end of this email I want you to say <strong>how</strong> you plan to make more money next year.</p>
