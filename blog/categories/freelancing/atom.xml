<p>The end of the year will be here soon. It's a time to reflect on how the past year went, and plan for the next year. There are three numbers that are the determining factors for your bottom line. By understanding these numbers, you will know what metrics you need to move in order to get the business results you want. By doubling just one of three numbers, you'll double you revenue, without doubling your workload. So instead of saying "I want to make more money next year", by the end of this email I want you to say <strong>how</strong> you plan to make more money next year.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Metric #1: Number of Leads</h2>

<p>You want to measure this as number of leads per month or per quarter. A <strong>lead</strong> is defined as any person who has expressed interest and capability in purchasing your services. If you respond to a listing on a job board, that is not a lead. However, if the person you contacted responds to you and wants to continue the conversation, that is a lead. If you are consistently turning some of leads into customers, then more leads will always equal more customers, which equals more revenue.</p>

<h2>Metric #2: Conversion Rate</h2>

<p>Your <strong>conversion rate</strong> is the percentage of leads that you convert into customers. Don't get discouraged if this number is low. I consider 10% to be a good conversion rate, and anything above that to be excellent. By increasing your conversion rate, you can increase the number of customers that you bring in, without increasing the amount of time you spend on sales. If you need 3 customers a month to make enough money, and your conversion rate is 5%, then you need to start conversations with 60 potential leads a month. If your conversion rate is 10%, then you only need 30.</p>

<p> <em>(If you don't use a CRM to track your leads and conversion, I would highly recommend getting one. There are hundreds to choose from, but I like <a href="http://bit.ly/1itwiuw">PipeDrive</a>)</em></p>

<h2>Metric #3: Customer Lifetime Value</h2>

<p><strong>Customer lifetime value</strong> (often shortened to 'LTV') is the average amount that a customer pays you as long as you two do business together. If you don't know what this number is, you can calculate it by adding up the total amount each client has payed you for all invoices, and then find the average. For example, let's say you bill weekly at $2,000 per week. Your last quarter looks like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Client A: 3 weeks of work:   $6,000</li>
<li>Client B: 5 weeks of work:  $10,000</li>
<li>Client C: 2 week of work:    $4,000</li>
<li>Your customer LTV:       $6,667</li>
</ul>


<p>The more you make per customer, then the less customers you need to make revenue.Once you know these numbers, you can project your income for 2015. The formula looks like this:</p>

<p><code>
$leads_per_month * $conversion_rate * $customer_ltv * 12 = $annual_revenue.
</code></p>

<p>So, let's say you made around $50,000. Your year might look like this:</p>

<p><code>
8 leads per month * 10% conversion rate * $5000 LTV * 12 = $48,000
</code></p>

<p>So, what if next year you want to make closer to $100,000? Instead of setting an arbitrary goal, now you can focus on moving the needle on a particular metric. If you wanted to double you revenue, you either need to figure out how to get more leads, increase your conversion rate, or increase the average amount a customer pays you.</p>

<h3>Tips for Increasing Leads</h3>

<ul>
<li>Adding an email capture to your website, start building a newsletter, and bring in clients that way.</li>
<li>Send more emails out on job boards that you frequent.</li>
<li>Give a seminar or a talk to prospective customers.</li>
<li>Double down on whatever is currently working for you. If you meet people in person, go to even more events.</li>
<li>Get more referrals, by asking for them. Reach out to past clients and current colleagues.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Tips for Increasing Your Conversion Rate</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/09/15/why-multiple-packages-in-your-proposals-instantly-increase-conversions/">Add packaging to your proposals</a>, in order to give clients more ways to say yes.</li>
<li>What have clients said before about why they decided to hire you? Work that into your emails and conversations.</li>
<li>Do clients trust you? Add some convincing work to your portfolio, or get testimonials from past clients.</li>
<li>Add calls to action to all of your client emails. Always make it clear how a client should proceed to move towards working with you.</li>
<li>Get comfortable saying this sentence to prospects: "So, what is going to take to get you to become a client of mine?"</li>
</ul>


<h3>Tips for Increasing Customer Lifetime Value</h3>

<ul>
<li>Raising your rate. Easy-peasy.</li>
<li>Find ways to provide more value for your clients. For example, if you are a developer, providing documentation for other developers or an ''instruction manual' to your client can be a value add that you should price for accordingly.- Offer auxilery services. If you design sites, you could also learn to handle some of the copy writing or data entry for the client.</li>
<li>Sell retainers. Find a way you can provide value to your clients on a monthly basis, and sell clients on those services.</li>
<li>Up-sell. The best time to add someone to the beginning of your sales pipeline is right after a completed project. If you can think of another project that would be beneficial to the client, or a retainer mentioned above, that would be the perfect time to sell them on it.</li>
</ul>


<p>What are your goals for 2015? And <a href="http://glennstovall.com/contact">what could I do to help you achieve them?</a></p>

    <id>http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/10/15/5-ways-to-build-a-200000-consultancy</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="/images/articles/5waysto_key.png" width="260"></p>

<p>I recently read an article entitled <a href="http://christophjanz.blogspot.com/2014/10/five-ways-to-build-100-million-business.html">5 ways to build a $100 million dollar business</a>. It discusses different business models that vary on the number and size of your customer base. Some businesses work with a few enterprise scale clients, while others work with a larger number of smaller customers. Patrick Mackenzie mentioned on Twitter that <a href="https://twitter.com/patio11/status/521878305151000577">"The math here is equally applicable if you are trying to build, say, a $200k a year business"</a>.A $200k/yr consultancy is a goal that seems both attractive and attainable, so I decided try and answer the question "How can you build a $200,000 consultancy?"</p>

<h3>Find 1 Client That Pays You $200,000 (The Elephant)</h3>

<p>I've been a part of projects where a single engagement has had a price tag of $200,000 or more. I think this scenario is a little unlikely. If you can find one of these clients, then you can find more, and you are on your way to becoming a $1mm+ consultancy. It would also be very risky for a company to put all of it's eggs in one basket like this.</p>

<h3>Find 10 Clients That Pay You $20,000 (The Deer)</h3>

<p>There are a few examples of consultancies that make this kind of money. One is custom application development services that can handle ten projects in a year. Most of the client work I find is in this range. Another example is high end consulting engagements. People like <a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/">Patrick Mackenzie</a> and <a href="http://doubleyourfreelancing.com/">Brennan Dunn</a> charge anywhere from $10,000 - $30,000 for a week of their services. They could work 10 engagements a year and hit this $200,000 benchmark.</p>

<h3>Find 100 Clients That Pay You $2,000 (The Rabbits)</h3>

<p>With this setup, your consultancy would have to have a service that scales very well. One way to accomplish this would be to find a way to service multiple clients at one time. Hosting courses or seminars is a way you could accomplish this. For example, Big Nerd Ranch offers <a href="https://training.bignerdranch.com/classes/advanced-ios-bootcamp">programming courses that cost $4,200</a>. At this point, the focus of the work changes. This is less of a consulting model and more of an information product model. There are plenty of gigs out there that pay $2,000 for smaller jobs, which are fine but those are hard to scale.</p>

<h3>Find 1,000 Customers That Pay You $200 (The Mice)</h3>

<p>At this level, you need a product that you can resell. It could be a course that requires little to no interaction for $200 (For example, a <a href="https://www.udemy.com/comprehensive-ruby-on-rails/?dtcode=Q73iZAp1GbIa">UDemy</a> course), or it could be some form of subscription product, which would cost just shy of $20/month. For software developers, you may be able to build a premium software framework or plugin that can sell for this amount. The <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/">Magento Connect marketplace</a> is a good example of people going this model. I can't think of any kind of repeatable service model that works at this scale.</p>

<h3>Find 10,000 Customers That Pay You $20 (The Files)</h3>

<p>You are a product business at this point. You could sell ebooks, themes, plugins, or something of that nature. You really can't call it a consultancy at this point. For this kind of business, it looks like the math doesn't scale don't quite so well at this point.</p>

<h3>Applying This To Your Business</h3>

<p>Do you want to work on $2,000 or $200,000 projects? Before you say "$200,000, duh." Think about the pros and cons of fewer clients vs. more, and smaller clients vs. large. Fewer larger clients means a more rigorous, in-depth sales process, and a higher risk if you lose a client.</p>

<p>What kind of consultancy do you want to run, and how are you going to scale it? You can scale not only by getting more clients, but by getting bigger ones as well. If you think about the kind of business you <strong>want</strong> to be running, then you can start making deliberate steps to get there.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/articles/kai-davis.jpg" width="260"></p>

<p>My friend <a href="http://kaidavis.com/">Kai Davis</a> was recently on the side hustle nation podcast. The episode is <a href="http://www.sidehustlenation.com/start-side-hustle-consulting-business-gets-paid/">How to Start a Side Hustle Consulting Business that Gets Paid</a>. One particular nugget of gold from this podcast: When asked what he would do if he had to start all over, Kai responds with how he would start a new consultancy in 16 hours.</p>

<h3>Hours 1-3: Identify A Target Audience</h3>

<p>Decide which market you want to focus on. This could be segmented geographically, or by industry type. If you aren't sure where to begin, try looking at local business directories. Your local chamber of commerce is a good place to start. You could even look in a phone book if you manage to find one.</p>

<h3>Hours 4 - 8: Book Four Calls (But Not Sales Calls)</h3>

<p>Start reaching out to people who you think might be potential clients. Ask them to sit down with you over lunch or coffee, or just hop on the phone with you to discuss their business. People love talking about themselves, and even strangers will be more receptive to this than you would believe. Your goal here isn't to sell them anything, this meeting is research. You want to find the <em>pain points</em> that your potential clients have.</p>

<h3>Hours 9 - 12: Begin Crafting A Service</h3>

<p>Now that you know what problems people in your target audience are having, how can you solve them? Look for ways you can apply your current skills and knowledge to these problems, or how to apply new skills that you could pick up in a reasonable amount of time. If you don't find a good fit, that's OK, you may just have to try again. You don't marry the first person you date, and you don't want to pursue the first job idea that comes to mind.</p>

<h3>Hours 13 - 16: Offer Your Solution</h3>

<p>Now you have connections to your market, and understanding of their problems, and a solution to those problems. Go back to your original contacts and offer your solution. Now you're in business!</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/articles/baseball.png" width="260"></p>

<p>When a freelancer submits a proposal, they will often only include one offer. They will set the deliverable, and the price, and throw their proposal over the wall. When you do this, you give the client a binary option: Hire you or don't.</p>

<p>By giving the client a few different options, you are changing the conversation into one that is more likely to end with the client hiring you.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>Selling Services is More like Selling Products Than You Might Think</h3>

<p>Many of the selling principles that I mention in this article are going to be identical to the once I addressed in <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/08/04/breakdown-of-a-pricing-grid/">Breakdown of a Pricing Grid</a>. There is more common ground in selling products and selling service than most people realize. When you submit a proposal, you are selling a product to a very specific customer, and you are only selling it once.</p>

<h3>Offers And Solutions</h3>

<p>All proposals that you write follow a simple narrative. "How are you going to get the client from point A to point B?". Point A is why they starting talking to you in the first place. This is a pain point they are having, or a moment they decided that they needed to change something in their business. A <strong>solution</strong> is "point B". The solution is tomorrow. The solution is the inverse of the problem. The <strong>offer</strong> is how you are proposing to get the client from point A to point B. There are multiple ways you can get a client from point A to point B, and these are going to be the basis of the packages you offer.</p>

<h3>The 3 Packages You Should Include In Your Proposal</h3>

<p>Let's say you are at bat in a baseball game. The problem is that you are not on base. The solution is that you want to get on base. There are several ways you can get there. The following is the 3 package template I use in my proposals: The bunt, The line drive, and the home run (now the image at the top of this post makes sense!). Approaching the proposal this way gets me thinking about multiple ways I can solve a client's problem, and helps me and my clients find the offer that fits their needs and wants the best.</p>

<h3>The Bunt</h3>

<p>The lowest package you should offer should be the absolute minimum you can do to get the client to where they want to be. I also call this the <strong>half-complete package</strong>. Based on previous communications with the client, this offer is usually <strong>less</strong> than what they originally asked for. This package is useful because customers that may not have taken your core offering may take you up on this one, turning non-clients into small clients.</p>

<h3>The Line Drive</h3>

<p>This package will be the most in line with what the client requested. In the middle package, I include everything that the client has asked for or that I no are 100% crucial to a successful project. I call this one the <strong>complete package</strong>.</p>

<h3>The Home Run</h3>

<p>Once I have a handle on what the client is looking for, I ask myself "How can I go above and beyond what they asked for?". There is where I come up with the final, most expensive package. I call this one the <strong>complete plus package</strong>. This package is a place where I can up-sell the client, and show my expertise.</p>

<h3>Multiple Packages Give You Built In Up-sells</h3>

<p>The complete plus package is a straight-up up-sell. You took the clients needs and offered to meet their expectations and then some. No matter which package your client buys, you will still have a chance to up-sell them. If they purchase the smallest package, you can always go back and offer to complete more work for them. You have already presenting the client with several offerings, and these can be valuable tools later on in the client relationship.</p>

<h3>Change The Conversation</h3>

<p>The biggest advantage to this approach is that instead of the client thinking "Do I accept this proposal or not?", They now have options. They think "Which option on this proposal do I choose?".</p>
