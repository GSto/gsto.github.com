<p><img class="left" src="/images/articles/audience_building_cover.png" width="260"></p>

<p>Four months ago, I decided to start building an mailing list. I wanted to build new relationships in my field and expand my network. Overtime I built the list to over 500 subscribers. After some conversations, I saw that other people were interested in how I did it. I sat down to write down a case study. I wanted to be as exact and transparent as possible. It got a little out of hand, but at the end I believe I've crafted a valuable guide for anyone who wants to start growing their audience.</p>

<h3>The Final Result</h3>

<p>This case study ended up being much longer than I anticipated. I wanted to be as specific as possible, so that other people could repeat what worked, as well as learn from my mistakes. In addition, I wanted to be transparent. I believe that the best way to teach is to teach <strong>everything</strong>. After I had collected all of my experiences, I went on to research what other people had done to grow their audience.</p>

<p>The result was over 60 pages of content, in what I originally thought might just be a blog article. I've put everything I've learned in a PDF, and you can grab it at the end of this article.</p>

<h3>Talking About Audience Building Live: September 30th</h3>

<p>After putting together this report, I thought it would be fun to talk to others about this in person. So, in addition to publishing this report, I am hosting a <a href="https://app.convertkit.com/concordant/09-30-building-audiences">live seminar in Athens, GA on Tuesday, September 30th</a>.</p>
