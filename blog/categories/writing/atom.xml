    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>People have probably told you that two things every business should be doing is generating content and building a list. The problem with this advice is that it usually comes wit no “how” or a “why”. Writing content as a marketing strategy is a slow burn with abstract benefits. But a solid strategy can bring in more customers, help you build relationships, and help you position yourself as an expert to others. And writing content that does this is not as hard as it looks.</p>

<p>One of the scary factors of creating a content strategy is that publishing consistently is valuable, but that requires a commitment. When you don't know <em>what</em> to write about, <em>how</em> to write about it, or how to get readers, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed. Here’s my 9-step process I use to generate content; A Roadmap you can use to start mapping out your content strategy.</p>

<h2>1. Keep A Swipe File</h2>

<p>If you are solving people's problems with your work, then you have more than enough jumping off points for pieces of content. Content is providing value at scale. If you are providing content in a one-to-one or one-to-few manner, you can turn that into content to provide that value to potential customers on the internet.</p>

<p>To keep track of these events, I keep a <em>swipe file</em>. My swipe file is a collection of thoughts, notes, and links that could become articles one day. Here are my sources for potential content ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Interesting Conversations.</strong> Did you have an interesting discussion that relates to your business with someone in a sales meeting or even just at the bar? Put it in the swipe file.</li>
<li><strong>Problems You Solved.</strong> Did you solve any interesting problems this week? Put a note in the swipe file. These notes are the source of my technical articles.</li>
<li><strong>Email.</strong> Did you write a good email response to someone or have an interesting discussion? Put it in the swipe file.</li>
<li><strong>Forums and Social Media.</strong> Did you write a good response to someone or have an interesting conversation on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, or some other forum? Put it in the swipe file.</li>
</ul>


<p>You’ll see from above the easiest way to build content is to <em>have conversations.</em> Writing content is just a one-to-many way to build relationships, so any one-to-one conversation you have is a solid jumping off point.</p>

<h2>2. Make Writing A Habit</h2>

<p>Nathan Barry talks about how the biggest difference maker in his business was <a href="http://nathanbarry.com/commitment-changed-career/">making a commitment to writing 1,000 words a day</a>. If you want to produce a lot of quality content, you need to make it a habit. Make time every day, even if it is only 15 minutes. If you don’t know where to start, that’s why you have a  swipe file. Open it and pick one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>The note in the swipe file that excites you the most.</li>
<li>If nothing is exciting to you, then just grab the oldest one.</li>
</ul>


<p>Another benefit to a consistent habit is that you can work on ideas while they are still fresh and exciting. If you write an idea and don’t flesh out the idea until six weeks later, you might find that your interest in that topic has waned.</p>

<p>The emotions you feel when you write will transfer over to the people reading it. Bored writers write boring content.</p>

<h2>3. Outline and Brainstorm</h2>

<p>Before you start hammering away at the keys, take a few minutes and figure out what it is you want to say. Sketch out the key points you want to hit and what you want to say about them. Having some idea of where you are going will make steps 4 &amp; 5 a lot easier and more efficient. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map">Mind mapping</a> can be useful here.</p>

<h2>4. Choose A Template</h2>

<p>Good content has structure, and you don’t need to reinvent the wheel every time you sit down to write. Songs have a verse-chorus-verse structure that can be repeated infinitely without losing people’s interest. In fact, following a pre-defined formula makes the content <em>more</em> accessible to the reader.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Pain, Dream, Fix.</strong> I got this one from <a href="https://unicornfree.com/2013/how-i-increased-conversion-2-4x-with-better-copywriting">Amy Hoy</a>. Talk about the problem, and then talk about how great things would be if your reader didn’t have that problem, then talk about how they can solve that problem. The pain you an engaging starting point.</li>
<li><strong>Lists.</strong> They can be cheesy, but the internet loves lists. If your content makes sense in a sequential order, then consider taking that approach.</li>
<li><strong>Stories.</strong> If you want to take a more entertainment based route, you can tell stories. Each story has a protagonist (either you or the reader), a conflict, and how they overcame that conflict.</li>
<li><strong>Comparisons.</strong> Write about ‘this vs. that’ and compare and contrast two products or opposing viewpoints.</li>
<li><strong>Essays.</strong> An essay starts with a thesis, then provides evidence to back up that thesis. Paul Graham is a master of this.</li>
<li><strong>Tutorials.</strong> Write a ‘how to X’ article. These are the easiest to write for me. Most of my tutorials are for my benefit.  If I run into a previously solved problem, then I can quickly reference what I wrote previously.</li>
<li><strong>Roundups.</strong> A Roundup is a collection of resources from other places online. This template is useful if you don’t have a lot to say on a subject but want to get something out there.</li>
</ul>


<h2>5. Write A Terrible First Draft</h2>

<p>You should have a clear vision of what you want to say, and how you are going to say it. Now it’s time to get to work. The main goal of your first draft is you put words on paper. The best way to this is to remember to do one thing:</p>

<p><strong>Give yourself permission to suck.</strong></p>

<p>Just write. Don’t edit. Don’t worry about filling in links or notes. If you need to find links or do research to back up your points, leave yourself notes to do that later. The most important thing here is that you are getting words down.</p>

<h2>6. Edit</h2>

<p>I like to give an article some breathing room, so I don’t write an article and publish it on the same day. When you are building a writing habit, you may consider have 2 - 3 writing days and 1 - 2 editing days.</p>

<p>No one produces something great on the first try. That’s why we don’t even attempt it with our terrible first draft. Now it’s time to take the marble slab of our terrible draft and carve out our traffic generating Statue of David.</p>

<p>When editing, we want to keep a few different people in mind.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Edit for your readers.</strong> Read your content, fill in any blanks, and do any ‘TODOs’ you left yourself. Remember when I said you didn’t have to find research links or fill in every section earlier? Time to take care of that.</li>
<li><strong>Edit for your haters.</strong> The internet is not always the nicest place. If you make an assertion, you need to back it up. One unclear or unsubstantiated claim is enough for someone to not give your entire piece any merit.</li>
<li><strong>Edit for your English Teacher.</strong> If there is another thing the internet doesn’t take kindly to, it’s spelling and grammatical errors. These can hurt your authority. I’d recommend reading Strunk &amp; White’s Elements of Style, and using <a href="http://glennstovall.com/recommends/grammarly">Grammarly</a> to automate the process.</li>
</ul>


<h2>7. Optimize</h2>

<p>When Optimizing we focus on the beginning and end of your article. The beginning is your headline, and the end is your call-to-action. These will be the artisan bread that accents the meat and toppings of your delicious content sandwich</p>

<p>The headlines j is to get people to read the rest of your article. Much like the structure of the article, it’s nice to have some templates in place for this. Here are a few I learned from CopyHackers that I use:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Timed premise:</strong> “How to Make A Delicious Sandwich in under 15 minutes.”</li>
<li><strong>Even If:</strong> “How to Make Delicious Sandwiches Even If You Can’t Afford Top-Shelf Ingredients.”</li>
<li><strong>How-To:</strong> “How to Make a Delicious Prosciutto Sandwich”.</li>
<li><strong>Quantity:</strong> “Make 100 Sandwiches Instead of Hiring A Caterer.”</li>
<li><strong>Lists:</strong> “35 Unlikely Sandwich Combinations.”</li>
<li><strong>Why:</strong> “Why You Should Be Eating Peanut Butter Banana Bacon Sandwiches.”</li>
<li><strong>Ultimate:</strong> “The Complete Sandwich Playbook.”</li>
<li><strong>Simile:</strong> “Make Sandwiches Like Alton Brown.”</li>
</ul>


<p>Remember that your headline needs to engage the reader and leave them wanting more. It should spark emotion and curiosity. Try writing a couple and coming up with the best one. It’s also important to note that you don’t want to over-optimize your headlines. Don’t be Upworthy. If your headline is salacious and your content doesn’t deliver, you will leave your potential customers feeling disappointed, frustrated, and lied to.</p>

<p>The call-to-action is what you want readers to do after reading the article. Your CTA doesn’t have to be a hard sell, nor should it be. You want to focus on engaging with the reader further. Here are some ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ask a question and ask people to respond by commenting.</li>
<li>Ask people to join your mailing list.</li>
<li>Offer people a lead magnet or bonus benefit, which is just another way to get them on your mailing list.</li>
<li>Ask people to email you or fill out your contact form.</li>
<li>Ask them to follow up with more information, like a survey.</li>
</ul>


<p>If you have a product, you can include a call to action here, but it depends on what you are selling. I prefer to get people to opt-in to further engagement where I can continue to interact with them and build trust, and try to make the sale later. The important thing is that without a call-to-action, your content is not going to be doing as much work as it should for you.</p>

<h2>8. Publish</h2>

<p>Content sitting in your notebook or on your hard drive isn’t going to do you any good. You have to get that content out there. It doesn’t matter what tools you use, just pick one and go with it. For your content, Your mailing list, WordPress, or SquareSpace are all fine outlets to use.</p>

<p>I’d recommend publishing as regularly if you can. Once a week is ideal; It doesn’t take a huge commitment, and if you are writing every day then having at least one good piece of content per week should be attainable. However, while consistency is important, I favor missing a week over putting out sub-par content.</p>

<h2>9. Publish Again</h2>

<p>You can use content more than once. Here are the publishing channels I put my content on, in order of preference:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://glennstovall.com/">My Personal Site</a></li>
<li><a href="http://glennstovall.com/letters/">My Mailing List</a></li>
<li><a href="medium.com/@gsto">Medium</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/today/author/36107098">LinkedIn Blog</a></li>
</ul>


<p>I space these out over a couple of weeks for each article. Also, every article doesn’t go on every platform; I only publish it when it makes sense. I mentioned earlier how publishing consistently helps you build a following and your expertise. When you can publish each piece of content up to four times instead of just one, publishing content consistently becomes much easier. You get a chance to get in front of more eyeballs and further grow your audience.</p>

<p>If you still aren't sure how to start generating content, or why you should do it, leave a question in the comments.</p>

    <link href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/10/02/30-day-publishing-challenge-postmortem/"/>
    <updated>2014-10-02T14:18:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/10/02/30-day-publishing-challenge-postmortem</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today is final day #30 of the <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/09/03/30-day-blogging-challenge/">30 Day publishing challenge</a>. Whenever I finish a project, I write a postmortem. I ask myself three questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What went well?</li>
<li>What went wrong?</li>
<li>What can I do better next time?</li>
</ul>


<p>This is a breakdown of the lessons learned from publishing a whole lot of content for a month.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>What Went Well</h2>

<h4>I Have Almost Double The Content on My Site</h4>

<p>More content tends to mean more search engine traffic, and more content to share. According to Google Analytics, my search engine traffic is up 4%, and social media shares are up 300%.</p>

<h4>I Learned How to Build A Strong Habit</h4>

<p>I have tried many weekly or monthly challenges in the past, and I tend to not do well at them. I'm not sure why this time was different, but I was able to stick it out for the entire 30 days. It gave me more confidence it taking on these kinds of challenges.</p>

<h4>I Make Fewer Spelling Errors</h4>

<p>And overall, I feel like my ability to put words on the page has improved. In addition to all of the articles and pages, I also put out a <a href="http://glennstovall.com/products/building-audiences/">60-page case study on building your audience</a>. It didn't go over as well as I would have liked, but putting 10,000 words about a single topic felt really good.</p>

<p>The key to getting better at anything is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_(learning_method">deliberate practice</a>#Deliberate_practice), and this challenge gave me an opportunity to practice my writing skills.</p>

<h4>I Had to Get More Creative</h4>

<p>I usually keep a list of article ideas that I can reach too whenever I need to write something. That list is barren after this challenge. However, it did force me to find some new ways to create content, and force me to put ideas on paper that were always sitting around waiting for 'one day'.</p>

<h2>What Went Wrong</h2>

<h4>I Published Some Sub-par Content</h4>

<p>Being constrained to publishing something everyday means that some content went out the door before I felt it was ready. I'm not as proud of some of the content as I should have been. This also meant they I published several shorter articles, when I usually tend to like writing longer form content.</p>

<h4>My Writing Wasn't Focused</h4>

<p>I believe you should publish content with some kind of goal in mind. By being forced to write everyday, I wrote about a variety of topics: <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/09/22/yeoman-plus-angularjs-plus-foundation-a-modern-front-end-setup/">front end development</a>, <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/09/15/why-multiple-packages-in-your-proposals-instantly-increase-conversions/">freelancing</a>, <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/09/09/how-to-write-more-personal-emails-to-your-list-that-get-open-and-convert/">email marketing</a>, <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/09/11/lessons-learned-from-thomas-edisons-factory-fire/">stoicism</a> and even <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/09/05/niche-blogging/">writing itself</a>. It leads to an unfocused site of content.</p>

<p>On the other hand, <a href="http://jamesclear.com/">James Clear</a> writes about bodybuilding, entrepreneurship, and photography, so maybe that isn't so bad.</p>

<h4>I Was Distracted</h4>

<p>I spent a bit more time on this than I should have. While I believe my content strategy is part of my larger business plan, I did invest too much during the month in writing. Once I got to day 17, the challenge became like a drug. I <em>had</em> to finish it at that point, sometimes at the detriment of more important work.</p>

<h2>What To Do Better Next Time</h2>

<h4>Write Instead of Publish Everyday</h4>

<p>I believe that writing is a valuable asset. It has helped me grow my business. The habit I built was also beneficial. Instead of being required to put something out there, In the future I want to focus on putting out fewer, more useful pieces.</p>

<h4>More Focus</h4>

<p>When you write frequently, you learn a lot about how to write. When you publish frequently, you learn a lot about how people react to what it is that you write. During this month I have learned what people like, and what people don't. This is going to affect what I publish about in the future. This month was playing around; now it's time to put some real effort in writing content that I hope you'll find valuable.</p>

    <link href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/09/29/good-copywriters-borrow/"/>
    <updated>2014-09-29T15:11:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/09/29/good-copywriters-borrow</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="/images/articles/thief.jpg" width="260"></p>

<p>I've spent a lot of time writing this year, and especially this month with the <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/09/03/30-day-blogging-challenge/">30 day publishing challenge</a>. Something I have discovered is that writing is not as hard as it looks. You may think that you have to write for inspiration to strike, and if doesn't, you can complain about "writer's block".</p>

<p>Writer's block just means you aren't looking heard enough. There is inspiration for copy everywhere. Pablo Picasso always said "Good artists borrow, great artists steal". When you don't know what to say about your company or your product, then it's time to go on a caper and find some messages you can use in your copy.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>Steal From Your Customers</h3>

<p>Keep notes on interactions you have with past, present, and future customers. Your copy writing needs to be in your customer's language, not your own. If you have collected testimonials, that can be a great place to start. Sales meetings, request for proposals, and job board postings are all also good places.</p>

<p>This will also help you create higher converting copy. People like when they read something and think "wow, they really get me!" By speaking your customers language, and addressing points you got straight from the horse's mouth, you will be more in tune with your customer's needs.</p>

<h3>Steal From Your Competitors</h3>

<p>Look at the sites of a few of your competitors, there are three things you want to pay attention to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Their headings and subheadings.</li>
<li>Their calls-to-action.</li>
<li>Anything else that makes you stop and go "Hmm!".</li>
</ul>


<p>You don't want to take these lines verbatim, but instead get an overall feel for how other people are approaching the market. You can make a spreadsheet of these three things to keep track.</p>

<p>This will also help you make sure that you are saying something unique. You don't have to be the best in your market, just different. You could even make your headline the opposite of your competitors. If they focus on being the biggest, you can focus on being a smaller, more personal brand, for example.</p>

<h3>Steal From Other People's Feedback</h3>

<p>Amazon reviews are another great source for ideas. Search for books related to your services, and see what people are talking about. Look at 5-star reviews to get an idea of what people like, and 1-star reviews to see what problems people have and what you should avoid.</p>

<h3>Further Reading</h3>

<p>The idea of this approach is to turn writing from a creative practice into a scientific one; From a passive way of writing to an <strong>active</strong> way. Joanna Weibe of CopyHackers has a great article on this idea: <a href="http://copyhackers.com/2012/09/headline-formulas-and-the-science-of-high-converting-copywriting/">Headline Formulas and the Science of CRO Copy writing</a></p>

    <updated>2014-09-05T14:11:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/09/05/niche-blogging</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Personal vs. Professional Blogging part III</h3>

<p>Should you write under your personal name, or under a company brand? I've addressed this question in other articles. At first, I planned on starting two blogs (<a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/03/05/personal-blogging-vs-professional-blogging/">part I</a>). I tried that for a while and realized that I was spending a lot of time trying to build two audiences when I could just be building one. The time invested was not paying off. So, I decided to combine my two blogs, and write everything under my personal name (<a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/07/29/why-i-am-killing-my-company-blog/">part II</a>). Today I'm covering a third option: Instead of writing under your name or your company, you write about a particular subject on a niche blog.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>Niche Blogging</h3>

<p>A niche blog is a blog that is centered around a certain  topic, instead of around you or your company. The goal of a niche blog is to educate and inform its audience. For example, if your potential customers ran a SaaS business, you would have a site that was dedicated to writing articles to help SaaS owners.</p>

<h3>Using Niches to Sell Products</h3>

<p>Brennan Dunn recently made a shift to writing a subject focused site instead of a personal or company one. Over the past couple years, Brennan had a podcast which lived on his personal domain <a href="http://brennandunn.com">brennandunn.com</a>. Whenever he wrote an article, he would publish it on the blog of his software product, <a href="http://www.planscope.io">Planscope</a>.</p>

<p>Brennan recently decided to change how he was publishing content. He created a new site <a href="http://doubleyourfreelancing.com">doubleyourfreelancing.com</a>, and moved all of his content over to that site. His content is based around selling to freelancers, and this site is all about growing your freelancing business. He got the name from one of his most popular products, <em>Double Your Freelancing Rate</em>.</p>

<h3>Using Niche Writing to Get Clients</h3>

<p>By building a site around a certain subject, you position yourself as an authority in that subject. A friend of mine, Denny Cave, works exclusively on the LightCMS platform. He has a site called <a href="http://www.lightignite.com">LightIgnite</a> , which is all about developing on the LightCMS platform. By doing this, he puts himself in the position of being <strong>THE</strong> LightCMS guy, and this brings him a lot of client work.</p>

<h3>Are You Changing Your Blogging Strategy Again?</h3>

<p>No. This time, I'm not changing how I am doing anything, But I think that this is a strategy worth talking about, and worth considering if you are looking for a new way to publish your content, grow an audience, and make more sales.</p>

    <link href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/09/03/30-day-blogging-challenge/"/>
    <updated>2014-09-03T14:15:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/09/03/30-day-blogging-challenge</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Come Ship More Content in September With Me</h3>

<p>I heard about this challenge that a friend of a friend is doing: blog every weekday for 30 days. Here's <a href="http://cdevroe.com/blog/9527/blogging-every-weekday-for-30-days">the original post</a>. Here's the post where I <a href="http://mattdsmith.com/30-day-blog-challenge/">heard about it</a>. I know writing is a valuable skill. Blogging can help you build your reach, prove your authority, and give you an way to provide value to your potential clients and customers by providing them with educational content.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>However, I want to modify this challenge a bit, just because I kind of hate the term "blogging". Blogging is just one way to deliver content, there are several others. Instead, I want to take on the "30-day publishing challenge". Under my rules, any of the following will count as my writing for the day:</p>

<h3>What Counts</h3>

<ul>
<li>Publishing a new blog post. This includes my personal site or sites such as Medium.</li>
<li>Publishing a new letter to people on my mailing list (yep, this is my Day 1)</li>
<li>Publishing a new page or re-writing an existing page on my personal or company site.</li>
<li>Publishing another form of long-form content, such as an email course, eBook, or PDF.
Here are things that don't count:</li>
</ul>


<h3>What Doesn't Count</h3>

<ul>
<li>Republishing existing content in a new form (I've been looking into using Quora's and LinkedIn's publishing platforms to get more reach)</li>
<li>Super short-form content (tweets, tumbles, facebook posts, etc.)</li>
</ul>


<p>Since I'm bending the rules a bit, I'm going to publish something every 30 days instead of just on weekdays. This also means that for the weekends I'll probably write three things on Friday and space them out over the weekend.</p>

<p>So you up to taking the challenge? If  <a href="http://www.glennstovall.com/contact">drop me a line</a>. I'd love to follow along with what you are doing.</p>
