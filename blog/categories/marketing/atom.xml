    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>People have probably told you that two things every business should be doing is generating content and building a list. The problem with this advice is that it usually comes wit no “how” or a “why”. Writing content as a marketing strategy is a slow burn with abstract benefits. But a solid strategy can bring in more customers, help you build relationships, and help you position yourself as an expert to others. And writing content that does this is not as hard as it looks.</p>

<p>One of the scary factors of creating a content strategy is that publishing consistently is valuable, but that requires a commitment. When you don't know <em>what</em> to write about, <em>how</em> to write about it, or how to get readers, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed. Here’s my 9-step process I use to generate content; A Roadmap you can use to start mapping out your content strategy.</p>

<h2>1. Keep A Swipe File</h2>

<p>If you are solving people's problems with your work, then you have more than enough jumping off points for pieces of content. Content is providing value at scale. If you are providing content in a one-to-one or one-to-few manner, you can turn that into content to provide that value to potential customers on the internet.</p>

<p>To keep track of these events, I keep a <em>swipe file</em>. My swipe file is a collection of thoughts, notes, and links that could become articles one day. Here are my sources for potential content ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Interesting Conversations.</strong> Did you have an interesting discussion that relates to your business with someone in a sales meeting or even just at the bar? Put it in the swipe file.</li>
<li><strong>Problems You Solved.</strong> Did you solve any interesting problems this week? Put a note in the swipe file. These notes are the source of my technical articles.</li>
<li><strong>Email.</strong> Did you write a good email response to someone or have an interesting discussion? Put it in the swipe file.</li>
<li><strong>Forums and Social Media.</strong> Did you write a good response to someone or have an interesting conversation on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, or some other forum? Put it in the swipe file.</li>
</ul>


<p>You’ll see from above the easiest way to build content is to <em>have conversations.</em> Writing content is just a one-to-many way to build relationships, so any one-to-one conversation you have is a solid jumping off point.</p>

<h2>2. Make Writing A Habit</h2>

<p>Nathan Barry talks about how the biggest difference maker in his business was <a href="http://nathanbarry.com/commitment-changed-career/">making a commitment to writing 1,000 words a day</a>. If you want to produce a lot of quality content, you need to make it a habit. Make time every day, even if it is only 15 minutes. If you don’t know where to start, that’s why you have a  swipe file. Open it and pick one of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>The note in the swipe file that excites you the most.</li>
<li>If nothing is exciting to you, then just grab the oldest one.</li>
</ul>


<p>Another benefit to a consistent habit is that you can work on ideas while they are still fresh and exciting. If you write an idea and don’t flesh out the idea until six weeks later, you might find that your interest in that topic has waned.</p>

<p>The emotions you feel when you write will transfer over to the people reading it. Bored writers write boring content.</p>

<h2>3. Outline and Brainstorm</h2>

<p>Before you start hammering away at the keys, take a few minutes and figure out what it is you want to say. Sketch out the key points you want to hit and what you want to say about them. Having some idea of where you are going will make steps 4 &amp; 5 a lot easier and more efficient. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map">Mind mapping</a> can be useful here.</p>

<h2>4. Choose A Template</h2>

<p>Good content has structure, and you don’t need to reinvent the wheel every time you sit down to write. Songs have a verse-chorus-verse structure that can be repeated infinitely without losing people’s interest. In fact, following a pre-defined formula makes the content <em>more</em> accessible to the reader.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Pain, Dream, Fix.</strong> I got this one from <a href="https://unicornfree.com/2013/how-i-increased-conversion-2-4x-with-better-copywriting">Amy Hoy</a>. Talk about the problem, and then talk about how great things would be if your reader didn’t have that problem, then talk about how they can solve that problem. The pain you an engaging starting point.</li>
<li><strong>Lists.</strong> They can be cheesy, but the internet loves lists. If your content makes sense in a sequential order, then consider taking that approach.</li>
<li><strong>Stories.</strong> If you want to take a more entertainment based route, you can tell stories. Each story has a protagonist (either you or the reader), a conflict, and how they overcame that conflict.</li>
<li><strong>Comparisons.</strong> Write about ‘this vs. that’ and compare and contrast two products or opposing viewpoints.</li>
<li><strong>Essays.</strong> An essay starts with a thesis, then provides evidence to back up that thesis. Paul Graham is a master of this.</li>
<li><strong>Tutorials.</strong> Write a ‘how to X’ article. These are the easiest to write for me. Most of my tutorials are for my benefit.  If I run into a previously solved problem, then I can quickly reference what I wrote previously.</li>
<li><strong>Roundups.</strong> A Roundup is a collection of resources from other places online. This template is useful if you don’t have a lot to say on a subject but want to get something out there.</li>
</ul>


<h2>5. Write A Terrible First Draft</h2>

<p>You should have a clear vision of what you want to say, and how you are going to say it. Now it’s time to get to work. The main goal of your first draft is you put words on paper. The best way to this is to remember to do one thing:</p>

<p><strong>Give yourself permission to suck.</strong></p>

<p>Just write. Don’t edit. Don’t worry about filling in links or notes. If you need to find links or do research to back up your points, leave yourself notes to do that later. The most important thing here is that you are getting words down.</p>

<h2>6. Edit</h2>

<p>I like to give an article some breathing room, so I don’t write an article and publish it on the same day. When you are building a writing habit, you may consider have 2 - 3 writing days and 1 - 2 editing days.</p>

<p>No one produces something great on the first try. That’s why we don’t even attempt it with our terrible first draft. Now it’s time to take the marble slab of our terrible draft and carve out our traffic generating Statue of David.</p>

<p>When editing, we want to keep a few different people in mind.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Edit for your readers.</strong> Read your content, fill in any blanks, and do any ‘TODOs’ you left yourself. Remember when I said you didn’t have to find research links or fill in every section earlier? Time to take care of that.</li>
<li><strong>Edit for your haters.</strong> The internet is not always the nicest place. If you make an assertion, you need to back it up. One unclear or unsubstantiated claim is enough for someone to not give your entire piece any merit.</li>
<li><strong>Edit for your English Teacher.</strong> If there is another thing the internet doesn’t take kindly to, it’s spelling and grammatical errors. These can hurt your authority. I’d recommend reading Strunk &amp; White’s Elements of Style, and using <a href="http://glennstovall.com/recommends/grammarly">Grammarly</a> to automate the process.</li>
</ul>


<h2>7. Optimize</h2>

<p>When Optimizing we focus on the beginning and end of your article. The beginning is your headline, and the end is your call-to-action. These will be the artisan bread that accents the meat and toppings of your delicious content sandwich</p>

<p>The headlines j is to get people to read the rest of your article. Much like the structure of the article, it’s nice to have some templates in place for this. Here are a few I learned from CopyHackers that I use:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Timed premise:</strong> “How to Make A Delicious Sandwich in under 15 minutes.”</li>
<li><strong>Even If:</strong> “How to Make Delicious Sandwiches Even If You Can’t Afford Top-Shelf Ingredients.”</li>
<li><strong>How-To:</strong> “How to Make a Delicious Prosciutto Sandwich”.</li>
<li><strong>Quantity:</strong> “Make 100 Sandwiches Instead of Hiring A Caterer.”</li>
<li><strong>Lists:</strong> “35 Unlikely Sandwich Combinations.”</li>
<li><strong>Why:</strong> “Why You Should Be Eating Peanut Butter Banana Bacon Sandwiches.”</li>
<li><strong>Ultimate:</strong> “The Complete Sandwich Playbook.”</li>
<li><strong>Simile:</strong> “Make Sandwiches Like Alton Brown.”</li>
</ul>


<p>Remember that your headline needs to engage the reader and leave them wanting more. It should spark emotion and curiosity. Try writing a couple and coming up with the best one. It’s also important to note that you don’t want to over-optimize your headlines. Don’t be Upworthy. If your headline is salacious and your content doesn’t deliver, you will leave your potential customers feeling disappointed, frustrated, and lied to.</p>

<p>The call-to-action is what you want readers to do after reading the article. Your CTA doesn’t have to be a hard sell, nor should it be. You want to focus on engaging with the reader further. Here are some ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ask a question and ask people to respond by commenting.</li>
<li>Ask people to join your mailing list.</li>
<li>Offer people a lead magnet or bonus benefit, which is just another way to get them on your mailing list.</li>
<li>Ask people to email you or fill out your contact form.</li>
<li>Ask them to follow up with more information, like a survey.</li>
</ul>


<p>If you have a product, you can include a call to action here, but it depends on what you are selling. I prefer to get people to opt-in to further engagement where I can continue to interact with them and build trust, and try to make the sale later. The important thing is that without a call-to-action, your content is not going to be doing as much work as it should for you.</p>

<h2>8. Publish</h2>

<p>Content sitting in your notebook or on your hard drive isn’t going to do you any good. You have to get that content out there. It doesn’t matter what tools you use, just pick one and go with it. For your content, Your mailing list, WordPress, or SquareSpace are all fine outlets to use.</p>

<p>I’d recommend publishing as regularly if you can. Once a week is ideal; It doesn’t take a huge commitment, and if you are writing every day then having at least one good piece of content per week should be attainable. However, while consistency is important, I favor missing a week over putting out sub-par content.</p>

<h2>9. Publish Again</h2>

<p>You can use content more than once. Here are the publishing channels I put my content on, in order of preference:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://glennstovall.com/">My Personal Site</a></li>
<li><a href="http://glennstovall.com/letters/">My Mailing List</a></li>
<li><a href="medium.com/@gsto">Medium</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/today/author/36107098">LinkedIn Blog</a></li>
</ul>


<p>I space these out over a couple of weeks for each article. Also, every article doesn’t go on every platform; I only publish it when it makes sense. I mentioned earlier how publishing consistently helps you build a following and your expertise. When you can publish each piece of content up to four times instead of just one, publishing content consistently becomes much easier. You get a chance to get in front of more eyeballs and further grow your audience.</p>

<p>If you still aren't sure how to start generating content, or why you should do it, leave a question in the comments.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Launching a new product can induce a lot of anxiety. If you have been working on your product for some time, it is easy to let the fear of uncertainty about public reaction take over. You might decide to push the launch the back until you can one feature a bit better, a part of the design a bit cleaner, or to fix one more outstanding bug. You end up pushing your launch back to next week, next month, or in the worst case, “one day”.</p>

<p>Apple just finished their <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/6/8/8745353/apple-wwdc-2015-highlights-announcements-recap">2015 WWDC</a>, and there are some valuable lessons startups can learn from Apple’s marketing strategy.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>A Launch is NOT A One-Time Event</h3>

<p>Apple hosts big events a couple of times a year for their line of products. They didn’t just launch the iPhone and iOS; they have launches every year for new apps and features. Instead of pushing a launch back so you can finish a new feature, you can instead see that as an opportunity to have a second marketing event in the future.</p>

<h3>A Launch is NOT Perfect</h3>

<p>OS X had a lot of issues when it first released, but that didn’t stop Apple from releasing it to the public. While you don’t want to move forward with a broken app, it’s important to realize that no piece of software is ever going to be perfect. This fact becomes more and truer the more complex a product becomes.</p>

<h3>You Don’t Have to Launch to Everyone All At Once</h3>

<p>Apple’s WWDC aims at building interest among developers so that they can populate the app store. They don’t announce all of their features to their whole audience; They launch once to people invested in the platform who tend to be early adopters. If you have an audience, you can launch to a small subset of people. This strategy gives you a chance to gather important customer feedback before planning your next launch.</p>

<h3>You Can Always Launch Again</h3>

<p>The iPhone didn’t gain traction until its third iteration. However, Apple could not have made it to that successful third version without the failed first two. By launching early, they were able to see what kind of issues people would run into in the wild, and make improvements based on real-world use of their product instead of making guesses in a lab. That kind of information is incredibly valuable.</p>

<h3>So… Just Do It</h3>

<p>In my experience, There is one main determining factor between my clients that have a lot of success and those that don’t: successful clients ship early and launch often, less successful clients don't. They spend too long waiting for “perfect” launch conditions.</p>

<p> Whenever you are anxious about launching, consider the alternative. The alternative is letting your product sit quietly on a shelf, not getting customers and bringing in revenue. A bad launch that nets you one client is better than not launching at all.</p>

<p>After all, if the launch doesn’t go well, you can always launch again.</p>

    <id>http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/09/09/how-to-write-more-personal-emails-to-your-list-that-get-open-and-convert</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>My Email Marketing Strategy In a Nutshell</h3>

<p>Email marketing converts better than social media or content marketing. Nathan Barry has a great <a href="http://nathanbarry.com/email-marketing/">write up with the numbers</a>. You can build a list by <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/08/04/start-using-drip-email-campaigns-today/">giving people  incentives in exchange for their email address</a>, reaching out to them directly, or offering people updates on as-yet-unreleased new product. But once you have built that list, how do you write emails that people on that list will actually want to read?</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>Drop The Newsletters and start writing emails</h3>

<p>Newsletters are usually ignored and end up right in the trash bin.  Instead of thinking of your emails to your list as newsletters, I want you to approach them like you would writing an email to one person. When I write email drafts, I will usually start with the line 'Hey Bob,', where Bob is a real person I know. If I write with a more personal tone in mind, it will show in the final result. Your formatting needs to match this more personal tone, so no more fancy email themes..</p>

<h3>7 Steps to Formatting Your Email</h3>

<h4>1.Remove all formatting.</h4>

<p>Your email should look just like you sent it from your GMail or Mailbox account. This means that you don't want any of the formatting that  email list providers offer. However, you don't want to send a plain text email either. Plain text takes away some key formatting tools, such as <strong>bolding</strong>, <em>italicizing</em>, and <a href="#">putting in links</a>.</p>

<h4>2. Write your subject line like you would a regular email.</h4>

<p>Don't title case your headline. Capitalize the first word, and then write the rest lowercase. Using questions in your subject line is a good way to increase open rates, but can become annoying if over used.</p>

<h4>3.Set the From Address to Your Address, and Encourage Replies.</h4>

<p>Emails are conversations, and conversations are a two-way street. The from address should be from your personal address if possible, and if not, one that you check and respond too frequently. Your subscribers should be able to reply to any of your emails and expect a response (it may not be obvious this is the case since the email is automated).</p>

<h4>4.Start with a salutation.</h4>

<p>If possible, capture the first name of people when they sign up for your list. This will allow you to start with a line like 'Hey [first_name]'. A person's name is their favorite word to hear, and it starts your email off on the right foot.</p>

<h4>5.Write short body copy.</h4>

<p>Some people like to send out entire articles in their email list. Personally, I don't like this approach and haven't had much success. If I have a lot to say, I will publish a larger article elsewhere, and include a short description in the email. I like to provide something extra to my subscribers, so I will usually provide additional examples or a personal story in the email.</p>

<h4>6.End with a friendly signature.</h4>

<p>I always sign my emails with "cheers, Glenn". Much like the salutation, This gives the letter a more personal feel.</p>

<h4>7.Often, but not always, include a PS.</h4>

<p>The post script is one of the most read part of the email, after the subject line and the first paragraph. Even if people don't want to read the rest of your email, they will check out the PS. In old letter writing, the 'PS' was where people would include something <em>so good</em> that they just couldn't leave it out. Your PS should only be a couple sentences long, and get straight to the point.</p>

<h3>The 3 Types of Emails to Send</h3>

<p>When writing emails to your list, there are three formats that I use:</p>

<h4>1.The Value Email.</h4>

<p>This email has no ulterior motive. This is simply an email that provides value to your list. You can provide value by offering something educational, useful, or entertaining to your list. <strong>you do not sell to your list.</strong> If someone was nice enough to sign up for your list, they deserve value from you in return. This is where you give it to them.</p>

<h4>2.The Soft Sell Email.</h4>

<p>The soft sell email is identical to the value email, with one small difference: You mention something you are selling as a secondary point in the email. The PS is a great place to do this. You can write a valuable article, then in the PS include a call to action. Now when I say "sale", I don't always mean that you are asking the people on your list to give you money in exchange for goods or services. A "sale" is anytime you are asking them to give up something of value in exchange for something of equal or greater value. When people sign up for your list, that was a sale. They exchanged access to their inbox for valuable information. In addition to selling products, you could ask them to sign up for a free trial, ask them a question, or ask them to attend an event such as a webinar.</p>

<h4>3.The Hard Sell Email.</h4>

<p>These emails have one goal: To get your users to buy something you are selling. Like the soft sell email, that sale could be anything from a transaction to a webinar sign-up. Use these <strong>sparingly</strong>.</p>

<h3>The Frequency of Emails</h3>

<p>I send out emails once a week, sometimes every two weeks. If you email your list more frequently than that, they may become fatigued. Some people push their list harder, and this is something that depends on your audience.</p>

<p>The only time I break this rule is when I am launching a new product or have an upcoming event. I will ramp up the emails to build anticipation for the event, and usually send reminders a week before, a day before, and even an hour before.</p>

<p>When it comes to email frequency, you should also be mindful of the frequency you use the three templates above. The hard sell email is OK sometimes, but if that is all you send, you will not keep your subscribers for long. My general rule of thumb is to keep a 2:1 ratio for helpful, valuable emails, and sales emails. Here is a 6-email rotation I tend to use:</p>

<ul>
<li>Value email</li>
<li>Value email</li>
<li>Soft sell email</li>
<li>Value email</li>
<li>Value email</li>
<li>Hard sell email</li>
</ul>


<p>That way, once I have gotten to the point where I am selling someone, I have already provided them a lot of value. This also means that I am only sending out sales emails once every 5 - 6 weeks. It may seem odd to spend a lot of time building a list and then sell to it so infrequently, but by taking this approach those sales emails are much more likely to get responses.</p>

<h3>Segment Your List As Much As Possible</h3>

<p>So far, all of this has been about making your emails more personalized. Doesn't it seem strange to be more 'personal', and then send the same email to your entire list? It's true, and one way to get around this is <em>segmentation.</em> Segmentation means that you break your list up based on past behavior, and sent broadcasts to smaller segments of your list. For example, if you are selling a certain product, it doesn't make sense to keep sending emails to those people asking them to buy that product. Instead, you could only send them valuable emails, ask them for feedback on the product, or sell them something else.</p>

<h3>Email Tools that Provide Segmentation</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.convertkit.com">ConvertKit</a>.</strong> I've mentioned ConvertKit before, as it is the email tool I currently use. They recently revamped their segmenting, and allow you to segment on users based on which email capture form they signed up for.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.getdrip.com">Drip</a>.</strong> Drip has moved from being an email list management tool to a full on marketing automation tool. They provide user tagging, and a lot of triggers that you can use to segment your audience.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.mailchimp.com">MailChimp</a>.</strong> Mailchimp recently released a whole new <a href="http://mailchimp.com/features/automation/">suite of automation tools</a>. These are new and I haven't tried them yet, but it looks promising. MailChimp is what a lot of people use already, so if this is you, you have a whole new set of toys to play with.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.infusionsoft.com">InfusionSoft</a>.</strong> InfusionSoft is the most powerful and most complex tool ons the market. They have a large start up cost (in the 4 figures), but they have a lot of tools and integration they make them the most in-depth marketing automation system out there.</li>
</ul>


<p>This is my entire email marketing strategy in a nutshell. By following these formulas, you can keep your list more engaged, and build a strong audience that is invested in you and your brand.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Increase Engagement And Conversions When People Sign Up For Your Email List</h3>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/articles/drip.jpg" width="260"></p>

<p><small class='notice'><em>This post originally appeared on <a href="http://www.concordantsolutions.com">Concordant Solutions</a>. Read <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/07/29/why-i-am-killing-my-company-blog/">why it moved</a>.</em></small></p>

<p>When building a mailing list, engagement is highest within the first two to three weeks of the person joining the list. However, these people usually get the same content that everyone else on your list getting. Wouldn’t it be great if you could send them content that was optimized for this situation. That’s what <strong>drip email campaigns</strong> are for.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>What are Drip Email Campaigns?</h3>

<p>Drip email campaigns are email campaigns that are sent out based on when a subscriber has performed an action instead of being scheduled on a calendar date. While a regular email list campaign may be scheduled to go out on June 1st, 2014 at 1pm, A drip email campaign will be scheduled to be sent out 3 days after a sign up.</p>

<p>Drip marketing campaigns are usually several emails in length. We want to reach out to a person multiple times (but too much, don’t be obnoxious) when they have first joined our list.</p>

<h3>Playing the Long Game</h3>

<p>No matter what you are selling, you are always selling people trust to some degree. People need to believe in your product and believe that you are capable of solving their problem before they will be willing to pay you money to do so. You can’t really build a whole lot of trust on social media or on a landing page. However, it takes much less trust to get someone’s email address, and from there you will have several opportunities to reach out to this person and build trust.</p>

<h3>How to Structure Your Campaign</h3>

<p>The most important thing about your campaign is that you need it to be helpful and valuable to your new subscriber. Your posts need to be mostly selfless. If you run a mailing list and all you do is sell to them, then you are doing it wrong, and it will drive people away. By selling directly less, you will build more trust, and make more sales in the end.</p>

<p>My personal rule is that your helpful content should have a minimum 2:1 ratio of being helpful, and being a sales email. Also, you should mix up between “hard sells” and “soft sells”. A hard sell is an email where the entire point is to get the user to complete a transaction. A soft sell is a message that is still valuable, but contains a subtle message.  For example, I may write an email about how to use lifecycle emails to increase conversions, and follow it up with “And by the way, this is something I love helping clients with. hit ‘reply’ if you would like to talk about us working together.”</p>

<p>Following those rules, here is what a drip campaign might look like:</p>

<ol>
<li>An introductory email.</li>
<li>An educational email.</li>
<li>An education email with a soft sell.</li>
<li>1 -2 more educational emails.</li>
<li>A hard sell.</li>
</ol>


<p>You can change this as you see fit, just stick to the 2:1 ratio.</p>

<h3>Your First Campaign</h3>

<p>If you have done any writing before, you can set your first campaign set up  quickly. Go find 4 – 5 of your best email campaigns or blog posts, and spread them out over 2 -4 weeks. You now have a campaign! This way you are giving your new subscribers your best content at a point when they are most engaged, making this some of the most effective email marketing you can do.</p>

<h3>Using Drip Campaigns as an Incentive</h3>

<p>Which do you think is a better call to action to get people to join a mailing list?</p>

<ul>
<li>Sign up for my newsletter.</li>

<p>I recently wrote a <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/05/09/freelance-pricing-handbook-launch-post-mortem/">case study</a> about how I used a free eBook in order to jump start one of my lists. You can use your drip campaign as the incentive by framing it as a service. For example, you may have a 30-day course that can teach your potential clients how to do something. ConvertKit is a drip marketing tool that does this on their first page. Since the service revolves around building forms to get people to sign up, they have a <a href="https://convertkit.com/">30 day course on creating forms that convert</a>.</p>

<h3>Tools for Drip Campaigns</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Mailchimp Autoresponders</strong> : Mailchimp doesn’t have any tools built specifically for drip marketing campaigns, but they do have autoresponders, which you can use to set one up. You can set an autoresponder to be sent out X days after someone joins a list, so you can create a drip campaign by creating several autoresponders.</li>
<li><strong>Drip</strong>: As you can tell my the name, Drip is designed specifically for creating drip campaigns. It also integrates well with other email list providers, so if you want to use Drip for your campaigns and Mailchimp or AWeber for your list management, you can do that.</li>
<li><strong>ConvertKit</strong>: ConvertKit is what I have been using lately. It has support for list management, drip campaigns, and offering sign-up incentives.</li>
</ul>


<p>By using drip campaigns, you can have a long form message that you can deliver to every single person that expresses interest in whatever it is your offering. If you have ever done sales where you had to have several emails or phone calls back and forth with a potential client, then you how time consuming that can be. Drip campaigns allow you to automate this process with the people that are in a situation where they are most likely to convert.</p>
