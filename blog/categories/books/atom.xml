<p> Today I'm proud to announce a new free eBook guide. The book is called the <em>Freelance Pricing Handbook</em>, and it's designed to help freelancers find their perfect rate. The most common question I hear from current and aspiring freelancers is "How much should I charge?" This book sets out to answer this question.</p>

<p> This book is designed to be a short and easy read to help you understand how to find your perfect price. In addition to help you find your rate, it also includes different ways to package and bill for your services. How you price and position your services has a bigger impact on your bottom line than the amount of skill you have. This book is designed to make sure you aren't undervaluing yourself and are getting paid the rates you deserve.
If you'd like a copy of the book, enter your email address below and I'll email you a copy.</p>
