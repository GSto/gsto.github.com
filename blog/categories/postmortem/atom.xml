    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today is final day #30 of the <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/09/03/30-day-blogging-challenge/">30 Day publishing challenge</a>. Whenever I finish a project, I write a postmortem. I ask myself three questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What went well?</li>
<li>What went wrong?</li>
<li>What can I do better next time?</li>
</ul>


<p>This is a breakdown of the lessons learned from publishing a whole lot of content for a month.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>What Went Well</h2>

<h4>I Have Almost Double The Content on My Site</h4>

<p>More content tends to mean more search engine traffic, and more content to share. According to Google Analytics, my search engine traffic is up 4%, and social media shares are up 300%.</p>

<h4>I Learned How to Build A Strong Habit</h4>

<p>I have tried many weekly or monthly challenges in the past, and I tend to not do well at them. I'm not sure why this time was different, but I was able to stick it out for the entire 30 days. It gave me more confidence it taking on these kinds of challenges.</p>

<h4>I Make Fewer Spelling Errors</h4>

<p>And overall, I feel like my ability to put words on the page has improved. In addition to all of the articles and pages, I also put out a <a href="http://glennstovall.com/products/building-audiences/">60-page case study on building your audience</a>. It didn't go over as well as I would have liked, but putting 10,000 words about a single topic felt really good.</p>

<p>The key to getting better at anything is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_(learning_method">deliberate practice</a>#Deliberate_practice), and this challenge gave me an opportunity to practice my writing skills.</p>

<h4>I Had to Get More Creative</h4>

<p>I usually keep a list of article ideas that I can reach too whenever I need to write something. That list is barren after this challenge. However, it did force me to find some new ways to create content, and force me to put ideas on paper that were always sitting around waiting for 'one day'.</p>

<h2>What Went Wrong</h2>

<h4>I Published Some Sub-par Content</h4>

<p>Being constrained to publishing something everyday means that some content went out the door before I felt it was ready. I'm not as proud of some of the content as I should have been. This also meant they I published several shorter articles, when I usually tend to like writing longer form content.</p>

<h4>My Writing Wasn't Focused</h4>

<p>I believe you should publish content with some kind of goal in mind. By being forced to write everyday, I wrote about a variety of topics: <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/09/22/yeoman-plus-angularjs-plus-foundation-a-modern-front-end-setup/">front end development</a>, <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/09/15/why-multiple-packages-in-your-proposals-instantly-increase-conversions/">freelancing</a>, <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/09/09/how-to-write-more-personal-emails-to-your-list-that-get-open-and-convert/">email marketing</a>, <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/09/11/lessons-learned-from-thomas-edisons-factory-fire/">stoicism</a> and even <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/09/05/niche-blogging/">writing itself</a>. It leads to an unfocused site of content.</p>

<p>On the other hand, <a href="http://jamesclear.com/">James Clear</a> writes about bodybuilding, entrepreneurship, and photography, so maybe that isn't so bad.</p>

<h4>I Was Distracted</h4>

<p>I spent a bit more time on this than I should have. While I believe my content strategy is part of my larger business plan, I did invest too much during the month in writing. Once I got to day 17, the challenge became like a drug. I <em>had</em> to finish it at that point, sometimes at the detriment of more important work.</p>

<h2>What To Do Better Next Time</h2>

<h4>Write Instead of Publish Everyday</h4>

<p>I believe that writing is a valuable asset. It has helped me grow my business. The habit I built was also beneficial. Instead of being required to put something out there, In the future I want to focus on putting out fewer, more useful pieces.</p>

<h4>More Focus</h4>

<p>When you write frequently, you learn a lot about how to write. When you publish frequently, you learn a lot about how people react to what it is that you write. During this month I have learned what people like, and what people don't. This is going to affect what I publish about in the future. This month was playing around; now it's time to put some real effort in writing content that I hope you'll find valuable.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="/images/freelance_pricing_handbook.png" width="260"></p>

<p>Whenever I finish a product, I like to write a post-mortem. A post-mortem answers a few important questions: What w went well? What went wrong? What could be done better next time? I usually keep these to myself, but this time I wanted to share. Building an email list is something every business should be doing, and I wanted to share the specific techniques I used in order to increase the size of a list 500% in 2 days.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>The Goal</h3>

<p>Start building a mailing list, and learn more about effective email marketing in the process. I plan on releasing a book targeted at freelancers hopefully in July, so I would like to start building a list now in order to build trust and have a targeted audience when I am ready to sell.</p>

<h3>The Process</h3>

<p> I signed up for Nathan Barry's <a href="http://www.convertkit.com">ConvertKit</a> Email list software. This includes enrolling in his "ConvertKit Academy" Which is an email course along with a few Google Hangout sessions with Nathan where you get a chance to talk about your personal goals.</p>

<p> Nathan heavily suggested that you have some form on incentive to get people to sign up for your list. He mentioned that you could do a free book, and it could just be a compilation of old writings. He also mentioned setting up a drip marketing course, and ConvertKit comes with a template for that. I looked over some past blog posts and decided to go that route.</p>

<h3>Writing The Book</h3>

<p> Writing the book, and I use the term writing loosely, took about a day. It's a compilation of a few different blog articles I had written, along with some content from a chapter I already had completed for my larger book profit. I drafted up a table of contents, and edited the content together, and wrote about 4 - 5 pages of new content to fill in gaps.  I made the PDF in Pages on the mac.</p>

<p> Then it came to the editing stage. I sent my current list of about 15 people an email announcing the book and asking if anyone wanted a copy. I also did the same of Twitter. I got a lot of amazing responses of people willing to read my book and offer feedback.</p>

<p> After I took a couple hours to edit the content together, I was ready to launch.</p>

<h3>Launching the book</h3>

<p>  Here were the steps I took in order to launch the book</p>

<ul>
<li>I added the ConvertKit form to several blog posts that I thought were relevant to the audience.</li>
<li>Created a <a href="http://glennstovall.com/books/freelance-pricing-handbook/">new landing page</a></li>
<li>Wrote two announcement posts, one on <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/04/29/announcing-the-freelance-pricing-handbook/">My personal domain</a> and on my <a href="http://concordantsolutions.com/announcing-freelance-pricing-handbook/">company domain</a></li>
<li>Posted links on Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and LinkedIn</li>
<li>Sent an email out to my original list about the book being released. Also included a P.S. asking them to share on Facebook &amp; Twitter if they felt so inclined</li>
<li>Asked my <a href="http://www.fourathens.com/">local tech community</a> to take a look and help out on social media if they wanted to.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Results</h3>

<p>  By the end of the week I had 84 new subscribers to my list. This was with 323 visitors and a conversion rate of 25.8%</p>

<p>  According to Google Analytics, My site had ~600 visits this week, mostly coming from direct traffic (which is odd, I feel like there are some referrals that don't get tracked properly), then Reddit, then Facebook, in that order.</p>

<h3>What went well</h3>

<p>  Having friends help out on social media seemed like a huge boost. I don't think I've gotten that much traffic from Facebook before. I also had a few people say nice things on Twitter, which I quickly embedded on the landing page as testimonials. The best way to expand your audience is to find ways you can leverage the audience of others.</p>

<p>  Also, writing a book, even when that book is just a PDF "best-of" of your blog, seems really cool to a lot of people. Content in PDF form is just seen as more valuable, and I think having this product out there gives me more credibility.</p>

<h3>What went wrong</h3>

<p>  I found out after the fact the form didn't render correctly on mobile devices, and made it impossible to sign up if you landed on the landing page via a phone. :( That definitely costs me a few conversions. I added a link below that links to a form directly, though perhaps I should find a better way to set up the form so that it renders in a more responsive friendly way.</p>

<h3>What I learned</h3>

<p>  Using incentives to build email lists really does work! My list went from 15 to 100 in a few days. It is also nice to always have something free to offer users in order to provide value for them.</p>

<p>  My next goal is to take these principles and find a way to apply them in a way I can use to target potential clients for my consulting services. I'm not sure what that is going to look like, but I'm sure if I keep writing it'll make sense eventually.</p>
