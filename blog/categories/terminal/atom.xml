<h3>Searching</h3>

<p>Searching is one of the most important tools in a developers tool belt. In this tutorial we will go over two commands that will make navigating the file structure of your machine easier, find and grep. One will be used to search for files by name, and the other will be used to search the contents of those files.</p>

</ul>


<h4>How to find certain files</h4>

<p>Finding files with a certain name is an easy enough command. It's <code>find</code>. The first argument in find is the directory you want to search, and then there are many other flags you can pass afterwards. The most common is <code>-name</code> , followed by the name of a file. for example, let's say you need to find a file named <code>lost.dog</code> and you want to search the entire file system. you would type:</p>

<pre><code>find / -name 'lost.dog'
</code></pre>

<p>You could also use <code>./</code> instead of <code>/</code> if you wanted to limit the search to just your current working directory. These queries (not only in find, but in all of theaw examples and many other linux tools) accept wildcards. if you wanted to search for all files with the <code>.dog</code> extension, you could run the command like so:</p>

<pre><code>find / -name *.dog
</code></pre>

<p><code>*</code> means 'anything' when searching. Besides <code>-name</code>, there are many other useful flags you can use:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>-iname</code> Works the same as -name, but is not case sensitive</li>
<li><code>-type</code>  Search by type. usually 'f' for file, or 'd' for directory</li>
<li><code>-perm</code> Search by permissions</li>
<li><code>-size</code> Search by file size.</li>
</ul>


<p>You can combine all of these. Let's say for example you want to find all hidden files in the current directory, but exclude hidden directories:</p>

<pre><code>find ./ -type f -name .*
</code></pre>

<h4>How to search text within files</h4>

<p>This is probably the most common search you will have to use, which can search the contents of files. This tool is called <code>grep</code>. It is an acronym for 'General Regular Expression Parser'. I could write an entire article on grep. In fact, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Grep-Pocket-Reference-OReilly/dp/0596153600/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1362369051&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=grep">entire books</a> have been written on the subject  but here I will just try to give you a brief overview of what grep can do.</p>

<p> The command <code>grep</code> takes two arguments: the query string we are searching for, and the file pattern we will be searching through. The query string is a <a href="/blog/2012/03/06/my-eureka-moment-with-regular-expressions/">regular expression</a>, and the file pattern is the name of a file or directory, or a string with wildcards and other special characters. In a simple example, let's say we have a file named <code>hello.rb</code> and we want to find where the line that says "puts 'hello, world' is.</p>

<pre><code>grep "puts 'hello, world'" hello.rb
</code></pre>

<p>Now, this search won't find anything if the line is slightly different. Let's say the line may have , Hello, World! instead. There are two things we can do to make this search less strict: pass the <code>-i</code> flag to make the search case insensitive, and not search for the entire string, only a part of it. We may also not be sure if the string is in <code>hello.rb</code> or some other ruby file, so let's search all ruby files in our current working directory:</p>

<pre><code>grep -i "hello, world" *.rb
</code></pre>

<p>This should return more results. In addition to -i, there are several other useful flags with grep:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>-v</code> Inverted match. this will only return files that don't match the query provided.</li>
<li><code>-r</code> Recursive. If a directory is specified, will also search all subdirectories</li>
<li><code>-n</code> Print out the line number of where the match was found.</li>
<li><code>-l</code> Print out the filename of where the match was found.</li>
</ul>


<p>All of these can be useful when trying to find a particular piece of text, for example when you need to find patterns or try to find the root of a bug. grep is much more powerful with a good knowledge of regular expressions, however that is beyond the scope of this article and hardly a beginner topic.</p>

<p>By now you've learned the basics of how unix named systems work, and many of the useful programs that are standard. Next time we will look at how to combine some of these with pipes.</p>

Building a command line interface into your application can be a way to add extra utility to you application. Adding cron jobs (a.k.a. scheduled tasks) to your CodeIgniter application can provide extra utility. In this article we'll show you how to set up both in a CodeIgniter application by writing a simple appointment reminder, which will remind people if they have an appointment scheduled a day in advance.</p>

<h3>Running Code Via The Command Line</h3>

<p>All CodeIgniter controller methods can be accessed via the command line. Let's start with a simple controller:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span>application/controllers/hello.php  </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
<span class='line-number'>16</span>
<span class='line-number'>17</span>
<span class='line-number'>18</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="x">&amp;lt;?php</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">class Hello extends CI_Controller</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">{</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">  public function index()</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">  {&lt;/p&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  echo &quot;Hello, World&quot; . PHP_EOL;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">&lt;p&gt;  }&lt;/p&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">&lt;p&gt;  public function greet($name)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">  {</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">   echo &quot;Hello, $name&quot; . PHP_EOL;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">  }</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">}&lt;/p&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">&lt;p&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>From the root application forlder, to call the index function we can do the following:</p>

<pre><code>php index.php hello
</code></pre>

<p>By passing the name of the controller to <code>index.php</code> , we are able to invoke the index method of the controller. If we want to invoke other methods, we can pass them as the next aguments. any arguments proceeding those will be passed as arguments to the method we are calling. So, to get the output of "Hello, Glenn" from this controller, we would run the following:</p>

<pre><code>php index.php hello greet Glenn
</code></pre>

<h3>Detecting command line requests</h3>

<p>You may want to write controller methods that behave differently based on wether or not they are accessed via the command line. you can do this by using the <a href="http://ellislab.com/codeigniter/user-guide/libraries/input.html">input library</a>, which has a function called <code>is_cli_request()</code> to detect if a request to a controller is from the command line or not. Here is an example if you want to make a method only accesible via command line:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span>application/controllers/hello.php  </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="x">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;?php</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">public function greet($name)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">{</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">    if(!$this-&amp;gt;input-&amp;gt;is_cli_request()) </span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">    {</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">        echo &quot;greet my only be accessed from the command line&quot;;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">        return;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">    }</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">    echo &quot;Hello, $name&quot; . PHP_EOL;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">&lt;p&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<h3>Setting up the Appointment Reminder</h3>

<p>Let's say we have a system where people can book appointments. We would like to send them a reminder a day in advance that they have an appointment coming up. In this tutorial we will set up a command line script
Let's set up our appointment reminder files. First let's start by building the table.</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'> <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='mysql'><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;/</span><span class="n">p</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">p</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="k">CREATE</span> <span class="k">TABLE</span> <span class="nf">appointments</span> <span class="p">(</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">id</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="kp">auto_increment</span> <span class="k">primary</span> <span class="k">key</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">email</span> <span class="kt">varchar</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">255</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">not</span> <span class="no">null</span> <span class="k">default</span> <span class="s1">&#39;&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">start_time</span> <span class="kt">datetime</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">is_reminded</span> <span class="kt">tinyint</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">not</span> <span class="no">null</span> <span class="k">default</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Now, we'll write a model that will perform the two primary data functions we need for this appointment reminder: a way to fetch all appointments on a particular day, and a way to mark them as appointments that have recieved reminders, so that we do not send multiple reminder emails:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span>application/models/appointment_model.php  </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
<span class='line-number'>16</span>
<span class='line-number'>17</span>
<span class='line-number'>18</span>
<span class='line-number'>19</span>
<span class='line-number'>20</span>
<span class='line-number'>21</span>
<span class='line-number'>22</span>
<span class='line-number'>23</span>
<span class='line-number'>24</span>
<span class='line-number'>25</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="x">&amp;lt;?php</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">class Appointment_model extends CI_Model</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">{</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">  public function get_days_appointments($day)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">  {&lt;/p&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$day_start = date(&#39;Y-m-d 00:00:00&#39;, $day);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">$day_end = date(&#39;Y-m-d 23:59:59&#39;, $day);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">return $this-&amp;gt;db-&amp;gt;select(&#39;*&#39;)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">    -&amp;gt;from(&#39;appointments&#39;)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">    -&amp;gt;where(&#39;start_time &amp;lt;&#39;, $day_start)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">    -&amp;gt;where(&#39;start_time &amp;gt;&#39;, $day_end)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">    -&amp;gt;get()-&amp;gt;result();</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">&lt;p&gt;  }&lt;/p&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">&lt;p&gt;  public function mark_reminded($appointment_id)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">  {&lt;/p&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  return $this-&amp;gt;db-&amp;gt;where(&#39;id&#39;, $appointment_id)-&amp;gt;update(&#39;appointments&#39;, array(&#39;is_reminded&#39; =&amp;gt; 1));</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">&lt;p&gt;  }</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Now that we can handle all the data transactions through the model. Let's write a controller so we can access this through the command line. In this example, we will put the logic in the <code>index()</code> function, since that is all this controller does. Personally, I like to put all of my command line scripts inside a folder named 'cli' inside of the controllers folder.</p>

<p>whenever this command line script is called, it will set an email to all people who have an appointment the next day. It will also mark there appointments as reminded to insure that we do not send multiple emails to the same person for the same appointment.</p>

<h3>Setting up a Cron Job (Scheduled Task)</h3>

<p>We would like to call this command line script once a day, at 1pm. You can edit the cron jobs your server runs with the following command:</p>

<pre><code>crontab -e
</code></pre>

<p>each line of the crontab file takes 6 arguments, which are, in order:</p>

<ul>
<li>minutes (0 to 59)</li>
<li>hours (0 to 23)</li>
<li>day of month (1 to 31)</li>
<li>month (1 to 12)</li>
<li>day of week (0 - 6)</li>
<li>command (command to be executed)</li>
</ul>


<p>you can use commas to seperate multiple values <em>(so <code>1,3,5</code> in the day of week field will be every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday)</em> , dashes to represent ranges <em>(so <code>09-17</code> in the hour field means every hour on the hour from 9am to 5pm)</em> and * for wildcards. <em>(so * in the hours fields means every hour on the hour)</em></p>

<p>Since we would like this script to run once a day at 1pm, our new entry into the crontab file would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>0 13 * * * php [application_path]/index.php cli/reminders
</code></pre>

<p>And now we can send out appointment reminders once a day. <a href="http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2009/06/15-practical-crontab-examples/">This Article</a> Has a lot of good examples for other ways to set up your scheduled tasks.</p>

<p>I also have a small helper file I use in CodeIgniter to make formatting output easier. You can check it out over on Github.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/articles/terminal.jpg" width="260"></p>

<p> In this article, we'll take a look at how file permissions works. We'll cover how users, groups, and file permissions work in a UNIX-based system, and how they can be used to make using the terminal more secure.</p>

<li>Read Part 2 <a href="/blog/2012/03/07/terminals-for-absolute-beginners-part-2/">Manipulating Files</a></li>
</ul>


<h4>Users and Groups</h4>

<h4>Understanding Permissions</h4>

<p> Let's begin by taking a second look at an example from lesson 1, the output on the command line when we ran the command <code>ls -la</code>:</p>

<pre><code>drwxr-xr-x 70 grp   glenn    4096 2012-02-15 09:35 .
drwxr-xr-x  3 root  root     4096 2011-03-15 16:55 ..
drwxr-xr-x  2 grp   glenn    4096 2012-02-07 09:21 Pictures
drwxr-xr-x  2 grp   glenn    4096 2011-08-23 15:29 Public
drwxr-xr-x  5 grp   glenn    4096 2011-09-28 13:30 Rails
drwxr-xr-x  6 grp   glenn    4096 2011-11-08 16:35 Repositories
drwxr-xr-x 12 grp   glenn    4096 2012-01-15 17:09 Server
drwxr-xr-x  2 grp   glenn    4096 2011-03-15 17:03 Templates
drwxrwxr-x  2 grp   glenn    4096 2011-08-11 08:46 Ubuntu One
drwxr-xr-x  2 grp   glenn    4096 2011-03-15 17:03 Videos
</code></pre>

<p>Now, what is of interest to us here is the first column. this is the list of <em>permissions</em> on a file or directory. if the permission is present, the letter is shown. if it is not, then there is a hyphen. so a directory with all permissions (anyone can do anything to it) would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>drwxrwxrwx
</code></pre>

<p>the first letter is actually not a permission, but a flag telling us what kind of file it is, most commonly <code>d</code> for a directory and <code>-</code> for a regular file. Next you will notice that there is a repeating series of 3 letters: r, w, and x. these are short for <strong>R</strong>ead, <strong>W</strong>rite, and e<strong>X</strong>ecute. The first three letters refer to the permissions of the user that owns the file. The second three letters refer to the permissions of any users in the group that owns the file. The third set of letters repesent the permissions of all other users (these are commonly called <em>world permissions</em> or <em>other permissions</em>). So let's look at a couple of examples and see what they mean:</p>

<p><code>drwxr-xr-x</code> : The owner may read, write or execute this directory; everyone else may only read or execute it.</p>

<p><code>-rw-r-----</code> : The owner may read or write to the file; people in the group have read-only access; no one else can do anything with it, and no one may execute it.</p>

<p><code>-rwxrwxrwx</code> : Anyone can do anything to this file.</p>

<h4>Octal Permissions</h4>

<p>Permissions can also be represented numerically. These are called <em>Octal Permissions</em>, as they are represented in base 8. In octal permissions, a 1 represents permissions to execute, 2 represents permissions to write, and 4 represent permissions to read. Since all sums of these numbers are unique, we can now represent the rights of any user or group with one digit between 0 and 7:</p>

<pre><code>| Number | Permissions |
------------------------
| 0      | ---         |
| 1      | --x         |
| 2      | -w-         |
| 3      | -wx         |
| 4      | r--         |
| 5      | r-x         |
| 6      | rw-         |
| 7      | rwx         |
------------------------
</code></pre>

<p>Now, we can use three digits to represent the permissions of a file. In a similar manner to above, the first number represents the user's rights, the second number the groups, and the third represents the world permissions. Our previous examples can be written as such:</p>

<pre><code>drwxr-xr-x  :   755
-rw-r-----  :   640
-rwxrwxrwx  :   777
</code></pre>

<h4>Manipulating Permissions</h4>

<p>If we want to change the permissions of a file, there are three commands we can use. The first is called <code>chmod</code> and is used for manipulating the file permissions. The arguments for chmod are an octal number to set the new file permissions, and the name of a file. you can also use the <code>-R</code> flag if you want to recursively change all the permissions of files in a directory. Example:</p>

<pre><code>chmod 777 file_name.txt
</code></pre>

<p>The second is <code>chown</code> , which is short for "change owner". It is used to change ownership of a file. It takes arguments in a similar fashion to chmod, but instead of an octal number, it takes a username as an argument. Example:</p>

<pre><code>chown glenn file_name.txt
</code></pre>

<p>The third is <code>chgrp</code>, which is short for "change group". Again, this command works in a similar fashion to chown, except that this command changes the group ownership of a file instead of the user. Example:</p>

<pre><code>chgrp psacln file_name.txt
</code></pre>

<p>Now that we have learned the basics of navigating the terminal, lets start looking at how to we affect the file system we're working in. In this tutorial, we'll cover the following: creating and deleting directories, copying and moving files and directories, and creating and deleting files.</p>

<p> <!-- more --></p>

<h3>Creating and Deleting Directories</h3>

<p> Wherever you left off in the last lesson, let's start by going back to home directory, and working from there. Remember that we can do this by running the command <code>cd ~</code>. Now, since we will be manipulating the file system in this tutortial, let's create a new directory that we can work in. You can do this by using the <code>mkdir</code> command. mkdir is short for "make directory". just type mkdir and the name of the folder you would like to create. For this example, we'll call it 'terminal-tutorial'</p>

<pre><code>mkdir terminal-tutorial
ls
</code></pre>

<p>When you run <code>ls</code>, you'll see that a new directory has been created. <code>mkdir</code> defaults to creating the directory inside the directory you are currently located. if you define a path, it will created the directory there. For example, lets make a directory inside of our terminal-tutorial directory, and then navigate there.</p>

<pre><code>mkdir terminal-tutorial/to-delete
cd terminal-tutorial
ls
</code></pre>

<p>You should see just the to-delete directory. If you tried to create a directory in a directory that did not exist, you would get an error. You can create nested directories at once by using the <code>-p</code> option, Like so:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir -p multiple/subdirectory/example
</code></pre>

<p>creates 3 new directories with those paths. Now lets says you need to get rid of a directory. For this we can use the <code>rmdir</code> command, which is short for 'remove directory'. Lets get rid of that pesky <code>to-delete</code> folder we made earlier, and the multiple directory example</p>

<pre><code>rmdir to-delete
rmdir multiple
rmdir: failed to remove `multiple': Directory not empty
</code></pre>

<p>You'll see that you get the following error message since <code>multiple</code> is not empty. <code>rmdir</code> can only remove empty directories.  Later in this artice we will discuss how can remove entire directories of files</p>

<h3>Creating and Deleting Files</h3>

<p>Now we can start creating and deleting files as well as directories. Let's start with the <code>touch</code> command. <code>touch</code> is to files what <code>mkdir</code> is to directories. so let's create a file:</p>

<pre><code>touch to-delete
ls
</code></pre>

<p>This creates an empty file named <code>to-delete</code>. To actually delete this file, we use the <code>rm</code> command, which is short for remove:</p>

<pre><code>rm to-delete
</code></pre>

<p>rm can also be used on directories, by using the <code>-r</code> option, which is short for recursive. This will also remove all the contents inside of a directory.  Occasionally you may get a prompt asking if you are sure you want to delete something. You can get rid of this with the <code>-f</code> option. You can use this to get rid of the <code>multiple</code> directory you created earlier</p>

<pre><code>rm -rf multiple
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to open and edit text files, you will need to get accquainted with a good text editor. <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> Are the two most popular, but both are very complex and a whole series of tutorials could be written on either one.</p>

<p><strong>WARNING</strong></p>

<p>It is a common joke on the internet to try to get people to run the command <code>rm -rf /</code> in the terminal. <code>/</code> refers to the base directory of your entire filesystem, so <code>rm -rf /</code> basically translates into "delete my everything forever, and don't ask for my permission". It is a <em>seriously</em> dangerous command to run, and now you know why.</p>

<h3>Copying And Moving Files and Directories</h3>

<p>Let's start by creating a couple more directories for this section:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir cars
mkdir vechicles
</code></pre>

<p>You may have decided that you made a mistake, and the <code>cars</code> directory should be inside of the <code>vehicles</code> directory. For situations like these, we have the <code>mv</code> command, which is short for move:</p>

<pre><code>mv cars vechicles/cars
</code></pre>

<p>The first option of the <code>mv</code> command is the directory you would like to move, the second argument being where you would like it to go. Since the names do not nessicarily have to match, <code>mv</code> also acts as a 'rename' operation for files and directories. If you want to <em>guarantee</em> the names match (and save you some typing), you can replace the final name of the file/directory with a <code>.</code> character, so these two commands are equivalent:</p>

<pre><code>mv cars vehicles/cars
mv cars vehicles/.
</code></pre>

<p>If you wanted to maintain the original <code>cars</code> directory and just put a copy of it in the <code>vehicles</code> directory, then you can do that wih the <code>cp</code> command, which is short for "copy".  Much like <code>rm</code>, <code>cp</code> works with both files and directories, but requires a <code>-r</code> for directories. The structure of the arguments is the same as <code>mv</code> though. So copying <code>cars</code> would have looked like this:</p>

<pre><code>cp -r cars vehicles/.
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the <code>.</code> syntax to keep the same name still works here as well.</p>

<h3>Protip: Tab Completion</h3>

<p>All of this typing on the command line can get tiresome. One of the best tricks to learn to cut down on the amount of keystrokes it takes to type commands is to learn about and get used to frequently using tab completion. If you type the first few letters of a directory or file name and hit tab, the shell will complete it for you! You must type enough characters for it to be unique. If not, pressing tab twice on most shells will show you all the directories and files that match the start of the name you typed. so for example, if you typed this:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir terminal-tutorial
cd te   
</code></pre>

<p>and this pressed the tab button, the terminal should automatically fill out:</p>

<pre><code>cd terminal-tutorial
</code></pre>

<p>Now we have a good set of tools for working with and manipulating the file system. Next time we'll take a look at users, groups, and the permissions system that UNIX is based on.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Directories and Commands</h3>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/articles/terminal.jpg" width="260"></p>

<p>You've woken up in a strange place. Maybe you've decided you want to be a power user with your mac. Maybe you've finally decided to check out this strangle 'Linux' thing you've heard so much about.  Maybe its your first day in software engineering class and the teacher is telling you you are going to have to work on the school's server to turn in all of your work. Either way, you find yourself eye-to-eye with a terminal (commonly called the <em>command line</em>) and you don't know what to do.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>Where Are We?</h3>

<p>Let's start by doing what anyone would do when dropped off in a new strange land. Let's figure out where we are and take stock of our surroundings.  Type the following command:</p>

<pre><code>pwd
</code></pre>

<p>this will tell you the directory you are currently in. It may look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>/home/glenn/
</code></pre>

<p>Let's make sure we are still who we think we are:</p>

<pre><code>whoami
</code></pre>

<p>This will tell you your username:</p>

<pre><code>glenn
</code></pre>

<p>Now, let's see what else is in the directory with us:</p>

<pre><code>ls
</code></pre>

<p>this gives us a list of all the files and directories in the directory we are currently in. but maybe we want a bit more information about this. let's type the following command:</p>

<pre><code>ls -la
</code></pre>

<p>and we get something like this:</p>

<pre><code>drwxr-xr-x 70 grp   glenn    4096 2012-02-15 09:35 .
drwxr-xr-x  3 root  root     4096 2011-03-15 16:55 ..
drwxr-xr-x  2 grp   glenn    4096 2012-02-07 09:21 Pictures
drwxr-xr-x  2 grp   glenn    4096 2011-08-23 15:29 Public
drwxr-xr-x  5 grp   glenn    4096 2011-09-28 13:30 Rails
drwxr-xr-x  6 grp   glenn    4096 2011-11-08 16:35 Repositories
drwxr-xr-x 12 grp   glenn    4096 2012-01-15 17:09 Server
drwxr-xr-x  2 grp   glenn    4096 2011-03-15 17:03 Templates
drwxrwxr-x  2 grp   glenn    4096 2011-08-11 08:46 Ubuntu One
drwxr-xr-x  2 grp   glenn    4096 2011-03-15 17:03 Videos
</code></pre>

<p>Whoa! there is a lot to take in here. Why did adding <code>-la</code> to the <code>ls</code> command change the output so much, And what is all of this stuff in front of the file names now? Why are there two files named <code>.</code> and <code>..</code>?</p>

<h3>Commands And Options</h3>

<p><code>ls</code> and <code>pwd</code> are both <em>commands</em>. <code>pwd</code> is short for <strong>P</strong>rint <strong>W</strong>orking <strong>D</strong>irectory and well, prints your current working directory. <code>ls</code> is shorthand for list and lists the contents of the current working directory. These are the first of many commands we'll  be going over. You can pass options to commands to change how they work. These are almost always formatted in the form of a single hyphen and a single letter, or two hyphens and a complete word.  You can combine single letter options with one hyphen, which is what we did when we typed <code>ls -la</code>. You could also write <code>ls -l</code> and <code>ls -a</code> and both would be valid commands. the <code>-l</code> argument tells the <code>ls</code> command to list the files on a single line with additional details. The <code>-a</code> command tells <code>ls</code> to show all files, including hidden ones. All directories contain at least two hidden directories, one called <code>.</code> and one called <code>..</code>, but we'll get to those in a moment.</p>

<p>Many commands have similar options, where the same arguments have similar effects with similar commands. There is one option that works with almost every command on the terminal, and its the most important one you'll ever learn. Are you ready? Got a pen?</p>

<pre><code>--help
</code></pre>

<p>This will print out an explanation of the commands function, and a list of options it can take and what they do. Go try running the following commands and checkout the output:</p>

<pre><code>whoami --help
ls --help
</code></pre>

<p>You'll see that <code>whoami</code> is a relatively simple command with very few arguments, where <code>ls</code> has a lot more options available. I could just replace a lot of text in this and upcoming articles with "just run <code>--help</code>", but I'm not going to. Feel free to explore some of the other commands and options that are available to them, and see what you can do with them.</p>

<h3>Traversing Directories</h3>

<p>Now I bet you are still wondering about that <code>.</code> and <code>..</code> stuff. These are both directories, or rather things that point to directories, that can be found in every single directory inside of linux based system. <code>.</code> Always points to the current directory. <code>..</code> Always points to the parent directory. If your current working directory is <code>/home/glenn/</code>, then <code>..</code> would point to <code>/home/</code>. If you make it all the way to the bottom directory (<code>/</code>), then <code>..</code> will still be there, but will also point to <code>/</code>.</p>

<p>Now let's learn how to change our working directory so that we can start traversing the folders around us. This brings us to our next command and last one of this article:</p>

<pre><code>cd
</code></pre>

<p><code>cd</code> is short for 'Change Directory'. To use this, we'll look at another thing we can do with commands: pass <strong>arguments</strong> to them.</p>

<h3>Passing Arguments</h3>

<p>Commands take arguments when they need additional information on what they do. You could think of it as a 'target' for the command. Commands can take multiple arguments, but in this case we'll only need one: Telling cd what directory we would like to change our directory too. So, if we want to go into the <code>Pictures</code> directory earlier. try running these two commands:</p>

<pre><code>cd Pictures
pwd
</code></pre>

<p>Now, based on the folder structure we looked at earlier, we should get an output similar to this:</p>

<pre><code>/home/glenn/Pictures
</code></pre>

<p>If we wanted to go back to where we were, we can reference that <code>..</code> directory:</p>

<pre><code>cd ..
pwd
</code></pre>

<p>and we are back at</p>

<pre><code>/home/glenn
</code></pre>

<h3>cd ProTips</h3>

<p>You can chain together directories to move multiple steps at once, like so:</p>

<pre><code>cd Pictures/Vacations/Vegas
cd ../../../
</code></pre>

<p>There are also two handy shortcuts available to the <code>cd</code> command:</p>

<pre><code>cd -
cd ~
</code></pre>

<p>the first is sort of an 'undo' option. if will take you back to your last working directory. the tilde (<code>~</code>) is short hand for your <em>home directory</em> which every user has.</p>
