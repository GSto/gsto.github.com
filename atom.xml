<p>In a previous article about <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/09/22/yeoman-plus-angularjs-plus-foundation-a-modern-front-end-setup/">Yeoman, AngularJS, and Foundation</a>, I talked about setting up a complete front end application scaffold with Yeoman, AngularJS, and Foundation. Now I want to look at how to test the AngularJS part of your application.</p>

<div style='clear:both;'></div>


<h2>The Tools</h2>

<h3>Karma</h3>

<p><a href="http://karma-runner.github.io/0.12/index.html">Karma</a> is a test runner for NodeJS. You can use it to simulate multiple devices. What Karma isn&#8217;t is a testing framework itself. It is designed to work with multiple testing frameworks, such as <a href="http://jasmine.github.io/">Jasmine</a>, <a href="http://qunitjs.com/">QUnit</a>, or <a href="http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/">Mocha</a>.</p>

<h3>Jasmine</h3>

<p>I&#8217;m using Jasmine for a couple of reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>I looked into Jasmine and QUnit before, and I have never seen two tools as similar. Their syntax is different, but how they function is <em>identical</em> last time I checked. Months ago I flipped a coin, it was &#8216;tails&#8217;, and I implemented Jasmine on a client project. No real reason to change.</li>
<li>I haven&#8217;t looked into Mocha. It might be better, or worse, or also identical. I don&#8217;t know. If <strong>you</strong> have an opinion, <a href="http://www.glennstovall.com/contact">let me know</a>.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s installed by default by Yeoman &#8230; sort of.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Step 1: Fix The Missing Dependencies</h2>

<p>For some reason, the <code>generator-angular</code> generator comes with some, but not all of the tools we&#8217;ll need for running tests with Karma and Jasmine, so we need to fix that before we get started. Run the following lines on the command line:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>npm install grunt-karma --save-dev
</span><span class='line'>npm install karma-phantomjs-launcher --save-dev
</span><span class='line'>npm install karma-jasmine --save-dev</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Step 2: Test the Tests</h2>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>grunt test</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This should ensure that everything is installed correctly. If you running a clean install from Yeoman, then it should run that test. You can look at the file /test/spec/controllers/MainCtrl.js for an example of what a test looks like.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Create A Simple Test</h2>

<p>Here is an example test, just to get you comfortable with the Jasmine testing Syntax. Create a file at <code>test/spec/app.js</code>, and write the following code:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="s1">&#39;use strict&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">describe</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;javascript&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">it</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;should know 2 + 2 is 4&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nx">expect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">toEqual</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">});</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I enjoy jasmine&#8217;s matchers and syntax because it reads like english.</p>

<p><code>describe()</code> is how you group your tests into suites. You can nest <code>describe()</code> calls as many levels deep as youwish, though any more than two and it gets really difficult to read and manage. <code>it()</code> is how you run tests. The first argument is the description, the second is the test itself. <code>expect()</code> is where you test your assumptions in the test, and <code>toEqual()</code> is your matcher. you can also add <code>not()</code> before any more matcher to test the opposite:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="c1">//it&#39;s 2014, not 1984 ... I think</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">it</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;should know 2 + 2 is not 5&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">expect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">not</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="nx">toEqual</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you want to know what other matchers are available to you with Jasmine, here is a handy <a href="http://www.cheatography.com/citguy/cheat-sheets/jasmine-js-testing/">Jasmine Cheat Sheet</a></p>

<h2>Step 4: Now For a Real Test</h2>

<p>By default, Yeoman comes with a controller test, you can see how it works there:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
<span class='line-number'>15</span>
<span class='line-number'>16</span>
<span class='line-number'>17</span>
<span class='line-number'>18</span>
<span class='line-number'>19</span>
<span class='line-number'>20</span>
<span class='line-number'>21</span>
<span class='line-number'>22</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">describe</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Controller: MainCtrl&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="c1">// load the controller&#39;s module</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">beforeEach</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">module</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;ngFoundationApp&#39;</span><span class="p">));</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">MainCtrl</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">scope</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="c1">// Initialize the controller and a mock scope</span>

</span><span class='line'>      <span class="nx">$scope</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nx">scope</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="p">});</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}));</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">it</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;should attach a list of awesomeThings to the scope&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nx">expect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">scope</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">awesomeThings</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">length</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">toBe</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">});</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">});</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Here you see some of the other handy features, such as <code>beforeEach()</code>. <code>beforeEach()</code> takes a function as an argument, and calls it before each test.</p>

<h2>Dependency Injection and Testing</h2>

<p>When you start writing tests you will begin to see why <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection">Dependency Injection</a> is so valuable. When you create services in Angular, you want to pass them as arguments instead of creating them directly. This way, you can create mock versions of anything for testing.</p>

<p>Here is an example test from a client project:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">it</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;should use tasks to set price if that is the invoice_method selected&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">$injector</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">invoke</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">Project</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">Feature</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">mock</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">Project</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">mock_project</span><span class="p">()).</span><span class="nx">prepare</span><span class="p">();</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I created functions that would return mock objects such as <code>mock_project()</code> and <code>mock_task()</code>. This way, I can test the <code>Project</code> object without the <code>Task</code> object. This way, all of my tests are completely self-contained, the waygood unit tests should be.</p>

    <link href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/09/22/yeoman-plus-angularjs-plus-foundation-a-modern-front-end-setup/"/>
    <updated>2014-09-22T14:18:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/09/22/yeoman-plus-angularjs-plus-foundation-a-modern-front-end-setup</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="http://glennstovall.com/images/angular.png" width="260"></p>

<p>With the combination of modern browsers and mobile devices having support for HTML5, CSS3, and new JavaScript APIs, front end development has become a lot more complex and exciting. There has been an explosion of tools as of late, and it can be daunting to know where to get started. Here are the tools and process I use in order to build a new front end application from scratch.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>The Tools</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Yeoman</strong> : For scaffolding our web application.</li>
<li><strong>Bower</strong> : For front-end dependency management.</li>
<li><strong>Grunt</strong> : Command line tool for development.</li>
<li><strong>AngularJS</strong> : JavaScript framework based on the principals of dependency injection.</li>
<li><strong>Foundation</strong>: Responsive SCSS Framework to speed up design.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Step 1: Install Yeoman and a Generator</h3>

<p>We&#8217;ll be using <a href="http://yeoman.io/">Yeoman</a> to handle all of our scaffolding. Yeoman will create the initial files and folder structure for you, so that you don&#8217;t have too. Yeoman uses generators, which are different templates it will use when creating your initial app. Yeoman is managed via npm. If you don&#8217;t have node and npm installed, you can get the <a href="http://nodejs.org/download/">NodeJS installer here</a>. I prefer building web applications with <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2013/06/27/angularjs-an-overview/">AngularJS</a>, so we&#8217;ll be installing a generator for an Angular application.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>npm install -g yo
</span><span class='line'>npm install -g generator-angular</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Step 2: Create The Scaffolding</h3>

<p>Now that we have our tools installed, it&#8217;s time to create our initial application. We&#8217;ll create a new directory and run the generator:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>mkdir example-app
</span><span class='line'>cd example-app
</span><span class='line'>yo angular</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you have everything installed correctly, Yeomen should start building your application. Select &#8216;yes&#8217; when it asks you if you want to install compass, then select no when it asks if you if you want to install Bootstrap. After a couple of minutes, you folder structure should look like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Gruntfile.js
</span><span class='line'>/app
</span><span class='line'>bower.json
</span><span class='line'>bower_components
</span><span class='line'>node_modules
</span><span class='line'>package.json
</span><span class='line'>/test</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Step 3: Install Dependencies</h3>

<p>Now we need to run our package managers to install dependencies. First, we will run NPM in order to install development dependencies, then <a href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a> to install front end dependencies:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>npm install
</span><span class='line'>bower install</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Step 4: Test The Servers</h3>

<p>Run the server and make sure everything is working OK:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>grunt serve</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Once this runs, navigate to <code>localhost:9000</code>. You should see the yeoman placeholder page.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Clean out the Crud.</h3>

<p>Yeoman adds a lot of content that is not needed. For example, it has multiple routes, controllers, and views already created for you. You can leave this in or comment it out if you want to keep an example, but I like to clear all of this out before I start working. Here is a quick checklist, so you don&#8217;t miss anything.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>app/index.html</code> - Remove most of the code in the body, but be sure to leave the div with the <code>ng-view</code> property.</li>
<li><code>app/views/main.html</code> - Remove the excess HTML.</li>
<li><code>app/scripts/app.js</code> - Remove the routes that you aren&#8217;t using. I get rid of the extra &#8216;about&#8217; route, and delete all the related files.</li>
<li>remove <code>app/controllers/about.js</code></li>
<li>remove <code>app/views/about.html</code></li>
<li>remove <code>spec/controllers/about.js</code></li>
<li><code>app/styles/main.scss</code> - Remove all of the unused styles.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Step 6: Install Foundation</h3>

<p>I prefer <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Zurb&#8217;s Foundation</a> to <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/">Twitter&#8217;s Bootstrap</a>. In my opinion, it&#8217;s easier to use and has cleaner markup. Since we are using Bower, this process is very simple. Open the <code>bower.json</code> file, and add this to the dependencies object:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>foundation: '~5.4.4'</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><em>Note: If you are reading this and it isn&#8217;t September 2014, then you may want to double check the version.</em></p>

<p>Then, we run <code>bower install</code> again. Done!</p>

<p>Now you have a front end application ready for development, with a whole suite of tools and frameworks installed.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://glennstovall.com/images/articles/kai-davis.jpg" width="260"></p>

<p>My friend <a href="http://kaidavis.com/">Kai Davis</a> was recently on the side hustle nation podcast. The episode is <a href="http://www.sidehustlenation.com/start-side-hustle-consulting-business-gets-paid/">How to Start a Side Hustle Consulting Business that Gets Paid</a>. One particular nugget of gold from this podcast: When asked what he would do if he had to start all over, Kai responds with how he would start a new consultancy in 16 hours.</p>

<h3>Hours 1-3: Identify A Target Audience</h3>

<p>Decide which market you want to focus on. This could be segmented geographically, or by industry type. If you aren&#8217;t sure where to begin, try looking at local business directories. Your local chamber of commerce is a good place to start. You could even look in a phone book if you manage to find one.</p>

<h3>Hours 4 - 8: Book Four Calls (But Not Sales Calls)</h3>

<p>Start reaching out to people who you think might be potential clients. Ask them to sit down with you over lunch or coffee, or just hop on the phone with you to discuss their business. People love talking about themselves, and even strangers will be more receptive to this than you would believe. Your goal here isn&#8217;t to sell them anything, this meeting is research. You want to find the <em>pain points</em> that your potential clients have.</p>

<h3>Hours 9 - 12: Begin Crafting A Service</h3>

<p>Now that you know what problems people in your target audience are having, how can you solve them? Look for ways you can apply your current skills and knowledge to these problems, or how to apply new skills that you could pick up in a reasonable amount of time. If you don&#8217;t find a good fit, that&#8217;s OK, you may just have to try again. You don&#8217;t marry the first person you date, and you don&#8217;t want to pursue the first job idea that comes to mind.</p>

<h3>Hours 13 - 16: Offer Your Solution</h3>

<p>Now you have connections to your market, and understanding of their problems, and a solution to those problems. Go back to your original contacts and offer your solution. Now you&#8217;re in business!</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://glennstovall.com/images/articles/audience_building_cover.png" width="260"></p>

<p>Four months ago, I decided to start building an mailing list. I wanted to build new relationships in my field and expand my network. Overtime I built the list to over 500 subscribers. After some conversations, I saw that other people were interested in how I did it. I sat down to write down a case study. I wanted to be as exact and transparent as possible. It got a little out of hand, but at the end I believe I&#8217;ve crafted a valuable guide for anyone who wants to start growing their audience.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>The Final Result</h3>

<p>This case study ended up being much longer than I anticipated. I wanted to be as specific as possible, so that other people could repeat what worked, as well as learn from my mistakes. In addition, I wanted to be transparent. I believe that the best way to teach is to teach <strong>everything</strong>. After I had collected all of my experiences, I went on to research what other people had done to grow their audience.</p>

<p>The result was over 60 pages of content, in what I originally thought might just be a blog article. I&#8217;ve put everything I&#8217;ve learned in a PDF, and you can grab it at the end of this article.</p>

<h3>Talking About Audience Building Live: September 30th</h3>

<p>After putting together this report, I thought it would be fun to talk to others about this in person. So, in addition to publishing this report, I am hosting a <a href="https://app.convertkit.com/concordant/09-30-building-audiences">live seminar in Athens, GA on Tuesday, September 30th</a>.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://glennstovall.com/images/articles/baseball.png" width="260"></p>

<p>When a freelancer submits a proposal, they will often only include one offer. They will set the deliverable, and the price, and throw their proposal over the wall. When you do this, you give the client a binary option: Hire you or don&#8217;t.</p>

<p>By giving the client a few different options, you are changing the conversation into one that is more likely to end with the client hiring you.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>Selling Services is More like Selling Products Than You Might Think</h3>

<p>Many of the selling principles that I mention in this article are going to be identical to the once I addressed in <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/08/04/breakdown-of-a-pricing-grid/">Breakdown of a Pricing Grid</a>. There is more common ground in selling products and selling service than most people realize. When you submit a proposal, you are selling a product to a very specific customer, and you are only selling it once.</p>

<h3>Offers And Solutions</h3>

<p>All proposals that you write follow a simple narrative. &#8220;How are you going to get the client from point A to point B?&#8221;. Point A is why they starting talking to you in the first place. This is a pain point they are having, or a moment they decided that they needed to change something in their business. A <strong>solution</strong> is &#8220;point B&#8221;. The solution is tomorrow. The solution is the inverse of the problem. The <strong>offer</strong> is how you are proposing to get the client from point A to point B. There are multiple ways you can get a client from point A to point B, and these are going to be the basis of the packages you offer.</p>

<h3>The 3 Packages You Should Include In Your Proposal</h3>

<p>Let&#8217;s say you are at bat in a baseball game. The problem is that you are not on base. The solution is that you want to get on base. There are several ways you can get there. The following is the 3 package template I use in my proposals: The bunt, The line drive, and the home run (now the image at the top of this post makes sense!). Approaching the proposal this way gets me thinking about multiple ways I can solve a client&#8217;s problem, and helps me and my clients find the offer that fits their needs and wants the best.</p>

<h3>The Bunt</h3>

<p>The lowest package you should offer should be the absolute minimum you can do to get the client to where they want to be. I also call this the <strong>half-complete package</strong>. Based on previous communications with the client, this offer is usually <strong>less</strong> than what they originally asked for. This package is useful because customers that may not have taken your core offering may take you up on this one, turning non-clients into small clients.</p>

<h3>The Line Drive</h3>

<p>This package will be the most in line with what the client requested. In the middle package, I include everything that the client has asked for or that I no are 100% crucial to a successful project. I call this one the <strong>complete package</strong>.</p>

<h3>The Home Run</h3>

<p>Once I have a handle on what the client is looking for, I ask myself &#8220;How can I go above and beyond what they asked for?&#8221;. There is where I come up with the final, most expensive package. I call this one the <strong>complete plus package</strong>. This package is a place where I can up-sell the client, and show my expertise.</p>

<h3>Multiple Packages Give You Built In Up-sells</h3>

<p>The complete plus package is a straight-up up-sell. You took the clients needs and offered to meet their expectations and then some. No matter which package your client buys, you will still have a chance to up-sell them. If they purchase the smallest package, you can always go back and offer to complete more work for them. You have already presenting the client with several offerings, and these can be valuable tools later on in the client relationship.</p>

<h3>Change The Conversation</h3>

<p>The biggest advantage to this approach is that instead of the client thinking &#8220;Do I accept this proposal or not?&#8221;, They now have options. They think &#8220;Which option on this proposal do I choose?&#8221;.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>How I Turned A Dredging Task Into a Learning Opportunity</h3>

<p>Despite all of the advances in technology over the past 30 years, in my opinion the best text editor for coding was created during the 1970s. <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> is a text editor that was developed at the MIT lab, created to aid engineers that were doing research on artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>Emacs is a powerful tool, one that I use everyday, but it is difficult to master. There are dozens of shortcuts and commands that you need to know in order to use if effectively. How did I learn them all? One at a time.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>I Learned Something New Because I Had No Choice</h3>

<p>I haven&#8217;t always used emacs. I started writing in more graphical text editors, such as <a href="http://www.crimsoneditor.com/">Crimson Editor</a> and <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>. Occasionally I would use larger IDE systems, such as <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/">PHPStorm</a>.</p>

<p>Then, I accepted a position at a software company in Washington DC. At this job coding was done on development servers, which means I had to log into the server via a terminal and work from there. I had zero experience with terminal based editors (kind of weird to think I made it <em>years</em> into my job before having to learn these skills). I was told that I two options: learn emacs or learn <a href="http://www.vim.org/">vim</a>. None of the tools I had used before were applicable here.</p>

<h3>The Age Old Question</h3>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war">Emacs vs Vim</a> is an age old question that developers love to debate about. I don&#8217;t want to open that can of worms here. At this job you were assigned a mentor for your first few weeks to help show you the ropes. My mentor used emacs, and would be available to help teach me there.</p>

<p>The primary difference in the two editors is how commands are structured. Both are 100% keyboard based. In Vim, you edit by having different &#8216;modes&#8217; that the editor can be set to. With emacs, you instead have a long list of shortcuts. Shortcuts either start with Ctrl, Esc, or Pressing Esc THEN another button. That actually isn&#8217;t enough to cover all of the commands needed, so then there are subsets of commands that are reached by pressing Esc+X or Ctrl+C, and then <em>another</em> command.</p>

<h3>How Could You Learn All This?</h3>

<p>Once I had completed the training at my new job, I was assigned to a job we all called &#8220;the pit&#8221;. The company had a large application with a huge customer base. It was the standard &#8220;legacy&#8221; application, meaning that it was old, complicated, and full of bugs. There were hundreds of support tickets and bug reports that had piled up, with new ones coming in every day. Keeping the bug queue in check was a Sisyphean task.</p>

<p>It was the job of the developers in the pit to work through that bug queue.</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t the most exciting job at the time, and often times I got bored. If I only I had heard the story of <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/09/11/lessons-learned-from-thomas-edisons-factory-fire/">Thomas Edison&#8217;s fire</a> back then, I may have considered this an opportunity to learn a lesson about discipline.</p>

<p>Instead, I made it an opportunity to learn about emacs.</p>

<p>I found a <a href="http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~helio/disciplinas/MC102/Emacs_Reference_Card.pdf">cheat sheet of emacs commands</a>. Every day I would pick one single command, and make it a point to use it as much as it was applicable. I would pick a new one the next day, but I would still be using the command from the previous day.</p>

<p>I did this for a month, and I had a much better working knowledge of emacs, and could write code and fix those bugs at a quicker rate.</p>

<h3>Incremental Gains Make Huge Differences</h3>

<p>The 30-day publishing challenge has given me yet another chance to apply this daily style of learning. Every day I am choosing another stylistic point from <em>The Elements of Style</em> and applying to my writing. These small, incremental gains add up to huge gains in productivity.</p>

<p>James Clear wrote an article about a <a href="http://jamesclear.com/marginal-gains">coach who worked in marginal gains</a>. Marginal gains has a compounding effect. If you are making small gains over time, they will pile on top of each other until to have made a mountain of progress. Conversely, if you slip over time you will end up digging a pit of failure.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Edison Understood Resiliance AND Electricity</h3>

<p><img class="left" src="http://glennstovall.com/images/articles/edison_fire.jpg" width="260"></p>

<p>On December 10th, 1914, Thomas Edison was having dinner with his family. A man rushes to his door and tells Edison that his factory had caught fire. Edison grabs his son Charles and they rush our the door. They head to the factory to see what is going on. When they get there the see a  vivid display of red, green, and blue fires, due to the various chemicals stored in his laboratory.</p>

<p>This could be the end of Thomas Edison. He didn&#8217;t even have insurance on the building, because it was designed to be fireproof. Edison looks at his son and says:</p>

<blockquote><p>Go get your mother and all her friends. They&#8217;ll never see a fire like this again.</p></blockquote>




<!-- more -->


<p>Charles protested, to which Edison responded:</p>

<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s all right. We&#8217;ve just got rid of a lot of old rubbish.</p></blockquote>


<p>How was Edison able to look at a career threatening tragedy and take such a light hearted approach to such a catastrophe? Edison understood the philosophy of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism">Stoicism</a>. Stoicism tells us that negative and destructive emotions are the result of errors in judgement.</p>

<h3>The Obstacle is The Way</h3>

<p>The principal teaching of Stoicism is that we should view challenges and stress as opportunities. Instead of seeing the factory as a catastrophic blow to his business, Edison saw an opportunity to start anew. If you are an entrepreneur, you <strong>need</strong> to get comfortable with failure.</p>

<h3>Facing Failure Head On</h3>

<p>Sometimes there will be failures that are your fault, other times they are not. There may be circumstances that you couldn&#8217;t foresee or plan for. The world is chaotic, and it doesn&#8217;t owe you anything; it was here first.</p>

<p>You can&#8217;t let the control of how you react to these scenarios slip from your grasp. Every time you see crisis, you have to try and see opportunity.</p>

<h3>A Personal Story</h3>

<p>Many freelancer&#8217;s are familiar with the term &#8220;feast or famine&#8221;. It alludes to the fact that with client work, when it rains, it pours. Sometimes lots of sales come through at once, other times they don&#8217;t. It can be stressful when work is slow. I had been feeling depressed and unmotivated for days facing a recent sales slump. However, by applying the philosophy of stoicism, I can see this in a very different light:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://glennstovall.com/images/articles/time_enough.jpg"></p>

<h4>Time Enough At Last</h4>

<p>People often complain about not having enough time to accomplish everything they want. I know I have. That&#8217;s no longer an excuse. I have a lot of hours to fill up every day with whatever I so choose.</p>

<h4>Going Completely Remote</h4>

<p>A big goal I have for my consulting business is to build a system that is completely remote. While networking locally tends to be the most effective way to build connections, and will always be a part of my business strategy, it can be limiting. The internet opens up the whole wide world, and I would like to build connections with people that live more than 20 miles away from me.</p>

<p>This will give me the freedom to run my business from anywhere in country. Hell, anywhere in the world. This is <strong>huge</strong> not as a business goal, but as a goal for living a happy life.</p>

<h4>A Through Post Mortem</h4>

<p>What have I done right? What I have done wrong? Having all this time gives me an opportunity to look at every part of my business, from marketing, to sales, to deliverables, and see what has gone well, and what hasn&#8217;t. I&#8217;m taking all this free time I have and applying to finding ways to deliver better service and more value to my clients, while building a more sustainable business for myself.</p>

<h4>A Learning Experience</h4>

<p>I have been working on a book this year entitled <em>Professional Freelance</em>. I planned on including chapters on sales and marketing. By having a challenge that many other freelancers face every day gives me an chance to find ways to approach it, learn and invent new solutions, and gather knowledge that I can share with other people and help other people grow their career.</p>

<h3>The Struggle Isn&#8217;t Real</h3>

<p>When facing hardships, it&#8217;s good to be reminded that they aren&#8217;t as bad as they first seem, if we approach them in the correct fashion. What did Edison do after his watched his plant burn to the ground in a spectacular fashion? He got a loan from his friend Henry Ford, and in three weeks he was up and running again. Edison went on to make $10 million dollars in revenue that year (~$200 million in 2014 dollars).</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll leave you with a video on Stoic Optimism, a TEDx talk by Ryan Holiday:</p>

<p><img src="http://glennstovall.com/images/articles/simple_long.jpg"></p>

<p>In design, I&#8217;ve always been a fan of minimalism. Minimalism is a philosophy about boiling things down to their essential elements. It&#8217;s about having a philosophy of &#8220;less but better&#8221;. Great thinkers from all walks of life have touted the benefits of this kind of approach:</p>

<blockquote><p>Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication</p><footer><strong>Leonard Da Vinci</strong></footer></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.</p><footer><strong>Albert Einstein</strong></footer></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>Simplicity is the final achievement. After one has played a vast quantity of notes and more notes, it is simplicity that emerges as the crowning reward of art.</p><footer><strong>Fredric Chopin</strong></footer></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius – and a lot of courage – to move in the opposite direction.</p><footer><strong>E.F. Schumacher</strong></footer></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it&#8217;s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.</p><footer><strong>Steve Jobs</strong></footer></blockquote>


<p>There is a universal truth that drives all of these musicians, artists, and visionaries. They all speak of the beauty and elegance of simplicity in all things. As entrepreneurs, we have the power to design not only our businesses, but our entire lives. However, many people end up working long hours, taking on lots of stress, and doing physical and mental harm to ourselves.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>My Email Marketing Strategy In a Nutshell</h3>

<p>Email marketing converts better than social media or content marketing. Nathan Barry has a great <a href="http://nathanbarry.com/email-marketing/">write up with the numbers</a>. You can build a list by <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/08/04/start-using-drip-email-campaigns-today/">giving people  incentives in exchange for their email address</a>, reaching out to them directly, or offering people updates on as-yet-unreleased new product. But once you have built that list, how do you write emails that people on that list will actually want to read?</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>Drop The Newsletters and start writing emails</h3>

<p>Newsletters are usually ignored and end up right in the trash bin.  Instead of thinking of your emails to your list as newsletters, I want you to approach them like you would writing an email to one person. When I write email drafts, I will usually start with the line &#8216;Hey Bob,&#8217;, where Bob is a real person I know. If I write with a more personal tone in mind, it will show in the final result. Your formatting needs to match this more personal tone, so no more fancy email themes..</p>

<h3>7 Steps to Formatting Your Email</h3>

<h4>1.Remove all formatting.</h4>

<p>Your email should look just like you sent it from your GMail or Mailbox account. This means that you don&#8217;t want any of the formatting that  email list providers offer. However, you don&#8217;t want to send a plain text email either. Plain text takes away some key formatting tools, such as <strong>bolding</strong>, <em>italicizing</em>, and <a href="#">putting in links</a>.</p>

<h4>2. Write your subject line like you would a regular email.</h4>

<p>Don&#8217;t title case your headline. Capitalize the first word, and then write the rest lowercase. Using questions in your subject line is a good way to increase open rates, but can become annoying if over used.</p>

<h4>3.Set the From Address to Your Address, and Encourage Replies.</h4>

<p>Emails are conversations, and conversations are a two-way street. The from address should be from your personal address if possible, and if not, one that you check and respond too frequently. Your subscribers should be able to reply to any of your emails and expect a response (it may not be obvious this is the case since the email is automated).</p>

<h4>4.Start with a salutation.</h4>

<p>If possible, capture the first name of people when they sign up for your list. This will allow you to start with a line like &#8216;Hey [first_name]&#8217;. A person&#8217;s name is their favorite word to hear, and it starts your email off on the right foot.</p>

<h4>5.Write short body copy.</h4>

<p>Some people like to send out entire articles in their email list. Personally, I don&#8217;t like this approach and haven&#8217;t had much success. If I have a lot to say, I will publish a larger article elsewhere, and include a short description in the email. I like to provide something extra to my subscribers, so I will usually provide additional examples or a personal story in the email.</p>

<h4>6.End with a friendly signature.</h4>

<p>I always sign my emails with &#8220;cheers, Glenn&#8221;. Much like the salutation, This gives the letter a more personal feel.</p>

<h4>7.Often, but not always, include a PS.</h4>

<p>The post script is one of the most read part of the email, after the subject line and the first paragraph. Even if people don&#8217;t want to read the rest of your email, they will check out the PS. In old letter writing, the &#8216;PS&#8217; was where people would include something <em>so good</em> that they just couldn&#8217;t leave it out. Your PS should only be a couple sentences long, and get straight to the point.</p>

<h3>The 3 Types of Emails to Send</h3>

<p>When writing emails to your list, there are three formats that I use:</p>

<h4>1.The Value Email.</h4>

<p>This email has no ulterior motive. This is simply an email that provides value to your list. You can provide value by offering something educational, useful, or entertaining to your list. <strong>you do not sell to your list.</strong> If someone was nice enough to sign up for your list, they deserve value from you in return. This is where you give it to them.</p>

<h4>2.The Soft Sell Email.</h4>

<p>The soft sell email is identical to the value email, with one small difference: You mention something you are selling as a secondary point in the email. The PS is a great place to do this. You can write a valuable article, then in the PS include a call to action. Now when I say &#8220;sale&#8221;, I don&#8217;t always mean that you are asking the people on your list to give you money in exchange for goods or services. A &#8220;sale&#8221; is anytime you are asking them to give up something of value in exchange for something of equal or greater value. When people sign up for your list, that was a sale. They exchanged access to their inbox for valuable information. In addition to selling products, you could ask them to sign up for a free trial, ask them a question, or ask them to attend an event such as a webinar.</p>

<h4>3.The Hard Sell Email.</h4>

<p>These emails have one goal: To get your users to buy something you are selling. Like the soft sell email, that sale could be anything from a transaction to a webinar sign-up. Use these <strong>sparingly</strong>.</p>

<h3>The Frequency of Emails</h3>

<p>I send out emails once a week, sometimes every two weeks. If you email your list more frequently than that, they may become fatigued. Some people push their list harder, and this is something that depends on your audience.</p>

<p>The only time I break this rule is when I am launching a new product or have an upcoming event. I will ramp up the emails to build anticipation for the event, and usually send reminders a week before, a day before, and even an hour before.</p>

<p>When it comes to email frequency, you should also be mindful of the frequency you use the three templates above. The hard sell email is OK sometimes, but if that is all you send, you will not keep your subscribers for long. My general rule of thumb is to keep a 2:1 ratio for helpful, valuable emails, and sales emails. Here is a 6-email rotation I tend to use:</p>

<ul>
<li>Value email</li>
<li>Value email</li>
<li>Soft sell email</li>
<li>Value email</li>
<li>Value email</li>
<li>Hard sell email</li>
</ul>


<p>That way, once I have gotten to the point where I am selling someone, I have already provided them a lot of value. This also means that I am only sending out sales emails once every 5 - 6 weeks. It may seem odd to spend a lot of time building a list and then sell to it so infrequently, but by taking this approach those sales emails are much more likely to get responses.</p>

<h3>Segment Your List As Much As Possible</h3>

<p>So far, all of this has been about making your emails more personalized. Doesn&#8217;t it seem strange to be more &#8216;personal&#8217;, and then send the same email to your entire list? It&#8217;s true, and one way to get around this is <em>segmentation.</em> Segmentation means that you break your list up based on past behavior, and sent broadcasts to smaller segments of your list. For example, if you are selling a certain product, it doesn&#8217;t make sense to keep sending emails to those people asking them to buy that product. Instead, you could only send them valuable emails, ask them for feedback on the product, or sell them something else.</p>

<h3>Email Tools that Provide Segmentation</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.convertkit.com">ConvertKit</a>.</strong> I&#8217;ve mentioned ConvertKit before, as it is the email tool I currently use. They recently revamped their segmenting, and allow you to segment on users based on which email capture form they signed up for.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.getdrip.com">Drip</a>.</strong> Drip has moved from being an email list management tool to a full on marketing automation tool. They provide user tagging, and a lot of triggers that you can use to segment your audience.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.mailchimp.com">MailChimp</a>.</strong> Mailchimp recently released a whole new <a href="http://mailchimp.com/features/automation/">suite of automation tools</a>. These are new and I haven&#8217;t tried them yet, but it looks promising. MailChimp is what a lot of people use already, so if this is you, you have a whole new set of toys to play with.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.infusionsoft.com">InfusionSoft</a>.</strong> InfusionSoft is the most powerful and most complex tool ons the market. They have a large start up cost (in the 4 figures), but they have a lot of tools and integration they make them the most in-depth marketing automation system out there.</li>
</ul>


<p>This is my entire email marketing strategy in a nutshell. By following these formulas, you can keep your list more engaged, and build a strong audience that is invested in you and your brand.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Personal vs. Professional Blogging part III</h3>

<p>Should you write under your personal name, or under a company brand? I&#8217;ve addressed this question in other articles. At first, I planned on starting two blogs (<a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/03/05/personal-blogging-vs-professional-blogging/">part I</a>). I tried that for a while and realized that I was spending a lot of time trying to build two audiences when I could just be building one. The time invested was not paying off. So, I decided to combine my two blogs, and write everything under my personal name (<a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/07/29/why-i-am-killing-my-company-blog/">part II</a>). Today I&#8217;m covering a third option: Instead of writing under your name or your company, you write about a particular subject on a niche blog.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>Niche Blogging</h3>

<p>A niche blog is a blog that is centered around a certain  topic, instead of around you or your company. The goal of a niche blog is to educate and inform its audience. For example, if your potential customers ran a SaaS business, you would have a site that was dedicated to writing articles to help SaaS owners.</p>

<h3>Using Niches to Sell Products</h3>

<p>Brennan Dunn recently made a shift to writing a subject focused site instead of a personal or company one. Over the past couple years, Brennan had a podcast which lived on his personal domain <a href="http://brennandunn.com">brennandunn.com</a>. Whenever he wrote an article, he would publish it on the blog of his software product, <a href="http://www.planscope.io">Planscope</a>.</p>

<p>Brennan recently decided to change how he was publishing content. He created a new site <a href="http://doubleyourfreelancing.com">doubleyourfreelancing.com</a>, and moved all of his content over to that site. His content is based around selling to freelancers, and this site is all about growing your freelancing business. He got the name from one of his most popular products, <em>Double Your Freelancing Rate</em>.</p>

<h3>Using Niche Writing to Get Clients</h3>

<p>By building a site around a certain subject, you position yourself as an authority in that subject. A friend of mine, Denny Cave, works exclusively on the LightCMS platform. He has a site called <a href="http://www.lightignite.com">LightIgnite</a> , which is all about developing on the LightCMS platform. By doing this, he puts himself in the position of being <strong>THE</strong> LightCMS guy, and this brings him a lot of client work.</p>

<h3>Are You Changing Your Blogging Strategy Again?</h3>

<p>No. This time, I&#8217;m not changing how I am doing anything, But I think that this is a strategy worth talking about, and worth considering if you are looking for a new way to publish your content, grow an audience, and make more sales.</p>

<p>In web development, the group of software, frameworks, and tools is called our &#8220;stack&#8221;. In businesses, you have a similar &#8220;stack&#8221;, which is made up of the tools and systems that you use to run your business. Today I wanted to list out my personal stack that I use.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Sales and Lead Management: PipeDrive</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.pipedrive.com/en/features/lead-tracking-software">Pipedrive</a> has the best visualization of the sales pipeline I have seen, and it can be completely customized. But the most valuable feature is that every time you finish a task that is related to a deal, it will automatically prompt you to create another. This way you never forget to follow up with a potential client, and deals don&#8217;t fall through the cracks. This is great way to keep track of your leads.</p>

<h2>Contracts: Docracy</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.docracy.com">Docracy</a> is a free resource for open source contract templates. It also has e-signatures, so you can use it to get contracts signed with remote clients. Here a couple of templates that I either use, or have my own modified version of:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.docracy.com/649dkpe7g9/contract-killer-3">General Work Contract</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.docracy.com/0i2fahvpv5t/statement-of-work-digital-advertising-services">Statement of Work</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.docracy.com/27/generic-shortform-nda">Generic Short Form NDA</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>Invoicing: FreshBooks</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.freshbooks.com">Freshbooks</a> is one of the largest invoicing tools out there. It makes generating invoices simple. Freshbooks is great if you bill by the hour, however since I moving away from that billing structure I have found Freshbooks to be a bit lacking. It doesn&#8217;t really have support for daily and weekly billing. But it does have simple time tracking, expense tracking, online payments, and really good reporting. I do appreciate that when tax time rolls around, I can print out a couple reports, hand them to my CPA, and boom. Done.</p>

<h2>Customer Support: ZenDesk</h2>

<p>When I was looking for a customer support tool, my one requirement was that it had to work 100% via email for clients. Clients are busy and don&#8217;t want to have to learn a new tool just because they found a bug. <a href="http://zendesk.com">Zendesk</a> met this requirement. My clients can send all inquiries to a support email address, and I can keep track of conversations and tickets via the application. When working with clients on monthly retainers, this is a great tool to keep things organized.</p>

<h2>Scheduling: Calendly + Google Calendar</h2>

<p>I hate having to go back and forth via email to schedule an appointment with someone. With <a href="http://www.calendly.com">Calendly</a>, I can send people a calendar of my availability, and they can select the time that works best for them. The real &#8220;killer feature&#8221; for me is the Google calendar integration: Not only does it add events to my calendar, it will automatically remove my availability if I schedule something else in that time slot, even if it wasn&#8217;t through Calendly.</p>

<h2>Writing Articles: Draft</h2>

<p><a href="https://draftin.com/">Draft</a> is a new tool I&#8217;ve started using recently. I love the clean interface and how easy it is to share drafts with people. I&#8217;ve been using to send some beta versions of chapters for my book project <em>Professional Freelance</em>. It also has a &#8216;Hemingway mode&#8217;, which disables the backspace and delete buttons for you. This makes the writing experience similar to writing on a typewriter, which is helpful when writing first drafts, and keeps you out of slipping into editing mode.</p>

<h2>Writing Books &amp; Courses: Scrivener</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php">Scrivener</a> is like Photoshop for words. It allows you to break your writing project in nested sections, and move them around freely. This way, moving chapters and sections around are easy. When I first began to attempt to write a book, I figured I would write an outline, and then fill it out. As the project went on, I&#8217;ve completely rearranged the books three times. Sometimes entire chapters are deleted, and whole new ones are added. Scrivener makes this process a breeze.</p>

<h2>Publishing: OctoPress + WordPress + Medium</h2>

<p>I have a few different tools that I use to publish content online:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> Octopress is the site you are reading right now. It&#8217;s a static site generator. That means that instead of having software like WordPress installed on a server, I generate the pages on my local machine, and put the result online. This way, there are no load times, and no worry of hacking because there is nothing to hack.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> WordPress is the granddaddy of online publishing, and I use it for my company site <a href="http://www.concordantsolutions.com">Concordant Solutions</a>. WordPress can be a bit unwieldy at times, but it does make publishing simple, and it&#8217;s impossible to beat the ecosystem around it. All of the plugins and themes available make it easy to get something set up quickly.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://medium.com">Medium</a> is a very slick looking online publishing platform. It was created by Ev Williams, one of the founders of Twitter. Medium is focused on longer form content and providing the best reading and writing experience for its users. The benefit of Medium is that it helps you reach out to new audiences. When I&#8217;m not writing here, I&#8217;m writing there. In fact, I am considering moving more of my writing over to Medium in the future.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Email Marketing: ConvertKit</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.convertkit.com">ConvertKit</a> is responsible for all those little calls to action at the bottom of each post. ConvertKit has a different approach from other mailing list providers. Instead of just putting everyone onto one list, you create different forms. These forms usually come with an incentive, such as a download or a course. Then, you can segment users based on which form they signed up for. This allows you to send more targeted emails.</p>

<p>In addition to forms that you can embed, ConvertKit also allows you to build landing pages which can then be embedded on your site. I also like the simple look of the emails. I hate the idea of &#8220;newsletters&#8221;. I view my list as communication at scale. ConvertKit is just an easy way to email a few hundred people and start some conversations. All the emails come from my email address so that you can hit &#8220;reply&#8221; to get in touch with me. And I always write back. If you want to see what one of their landing pages looks like and/or sign up for my list, <a href="https://app.convertkit.com/concordant/letters">Here is the link</a></p>

    <link href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/09/03/30-day-blogging-challenge/"/>
    <updated>2014-09-03T14:15:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/09/03/30-day-blogging-challenge</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Come Ship More Content in September With Me</h3>

<p>I heard about this challenge that a friend of a friend is doing: blog every weekday for 30 days. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://cdevroe.com/blog/9527/blogging-every-weekday-for-30-days">the original post</a>. Here&#8217;s the post where I <a href="http://mattdsmith.com/30-day-blog-challenge/">heard about it</a>. I know writing is a valuable skill. Blogging can help you build your reach, prove your authority, and give you an way to provide value to your potential clients and customers by providing them with educational content.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>However, I want to modify this challenge a bit, just because I kind of hate the term &#8220;blogging&#8221;. Blogging is just one way to deliver content, there are several others. Instead, I want to take on the &#8220;30-day publishing challenge&#8221;. Under my rules, any of the following will count as my writing for the day:</p>

<h3>What Counts</h3>

<ul>
<li>Publishing a new blog post. This includes my personal site or sites such as Medium.</li>
<li>Publishing a new letter to people on my mailing list (yep, this is my Day 1)</li>
<li>Publishing a new page or re-writing an existing page on my personal or company site.</li>
<li>Publishing another form of long-form content, such as an email course, eBook, or PDF.
Here are things that don&#8217;t count:</li>
</ul>


<h3>What Doesn&#8217;t Count</h3>

<ul>
<li>Republishing existing content in a new form (I&#8217;ve been looking into using Quora&#8217;s and LinkedIn&#8217;s publishing platforms to get more reach)</li>
<li>Super short-form content (tweets, tumbles, facebook posts, etc.)</li>
</ul>


<p>Since I&#8217;m bending the rules a bit, I&#8217;m going to publish something every 30 days instead of just on weekdays. This also means that for the weekends I&#8217;ll probably write three things on Friday and space them out over the weekend.</p>

<p>So you up to taking the challenge? If  <a href="http://www.glennstovall.com/contact">drop me a line</a>. I&#8217;d love to follow along with what you are doing.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://glennstovall.com/images/articles/bidsketch_pricing_full.png" width="260"></p>

<p><small class='notice'><em>This post originally appeared on <a href="http://www.concordantsolutions.com">Concordant Solutions</a>. Read <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/07/29/why-i-am-killing-my-company-blog/">why it moved</a>.</em></small></p>

<p>You may have noticed that on many software as a service pricing pages, they tend to look the same. There are always a few plans, usually 3, and they middle is <strong>always</strong> the most popular. This isn’t an accident. This is all designed to get the maximum value out of a customer. Let’s take a look at one company’s pricing model and why it is effective.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img class="center" src="http://glennstovall.com/images/articles/bidsketch_pricing_full.png"></p>

<p>I got this table from <a href="http://www.bidsketch.com/pricing/">BidSketch’s pricing page</a>. BidSketch is a tool that helps freelancers and agencies write and send winning proposals. This table is important to BidSketch. Literally every single customer, and therefore every single dollar, comes from this page. Nothing in this table is an accident. Let’s take a look at the plan names:</p>

<h3>Customer Segmentation</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="http://glennstovall.com/images/articles/bidsketch-segmentation.png"></p>

<p>you’ll notice that BidSketch doesn’t call it’s plans “small/medium/large”, or “bronze/silver/gold” or anything generic like that. Instead, they know that they have different kinds of customers, and that those customers are willing to pay different rates. They aim at three of their types of clients: individual freelancers, small studios, and large agencies.</p>

<p>Why do they charge agencies more money? Because agencies get more value out of BidSketch than freelancers. The proposals that large agencies are sending out are an order of magnitude larger than the one a freelancer is sending out.</p>

<p>This is the most important part of pricing any service or product: <strong>when the customer gets more value out of your product or service, you need to be getting more value from that customer.</strong> Doing this aligns your incentives with the customer’s. This means that now you and the customer are a team. Since you make money off of your customer being successful, you will do everything you can to help your customer. Since BidSketch knows that if they help their customers make more money by helping them write better proposals, they are going to do everything they can to make the best proposal tool out there? It’s a win-win for everybody.</p>

<h3>Pricing Ratio</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="http://glennstovall.com/images/articles/bidsketch-pricing.png"></p>

<p>Firstly, you’ll notice that BidSketch put their highest price package first. This is an old-school marketing trick. By looking at the initial plan first, the $79 and $29 plans will feel much cheaper in comparison. The highest selling price plan is almost never the highest selling one, it is mostly their for comparison. This is called <em>price anchoring.</em></p>

<p>You also want to have a decent ratio between your prices. If their prices were $29 / $39 / $49, they aren’t getting much extra value out of the plans. In fact, <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ryandelk/micro-conf-final">Ryan Delk at Gumroad</a> has looked at all the sales of digital products, and has found the optimal ratios for tiered pricing:</p>

<h4><em>1x 2.2x 5x</em></h4>

<p>Where ‘X’ is the base cost of your service. You’ll see that BidSketch follows this ratio closely: $79 = 2.7x , $149 = 5.1x . Note that ratio is just an approximation, and you don’t have to follow it exactly.  <em>(I don’t think BidSketch would get the same revenue with a $29 /  $63.80  / $145 model)</em></p>

<h3>Approximating Value</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="http://glennstovall.com/images/articles/bidsketch-features.png"></p>

<p>I said before that the best way to split up your pricing is to align your values with the customer’s. BidSketch could do this directly if they wanted too, and base their pricing on how the total dollar value of proposals that you close each month (payment processors such as <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> and <a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/">Briaintree</a> have the easiest alignment ever. They just get 2.7% of the revenue you bring in). In other cases, you may not have a way of directly knowing how valuable your service is to a client. In that case, you want to approximate the value. You do this by tying your pricing to something that is correlated to value. BidSketch does this in two ways: the number of users, and the amount of storage. Instead of looking a dollar value, they are looking at three things with these features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Number of employees / contractors you have working for you.</li>
<li>The number of proposals you are sending out.</li>
<li>The quality of proposals you are sending out. (i.e. using more photos &amp; videos, hence more storage)</li>
</ul>


<p>A company that has multiple people (agencies, studios) have to be making payroll, which means they are almost always making more money. That’s why you see a lot of software as a service products segment on number of users. One of the things that has held me back from hiring an assistant is I know the minute I have one employee my monthly software bill would shoot up a few hundred dollars a month.</p>

<p>There are two version control services that software developers use: <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">BitBucket</a>. A version control service is a place where developers can store and collaborate on code. BitBucket increases prices based number of users, but GitHub prices based on number of projects. I feel like GitHub missed the mark on this pricing. Number of projects is a false approximation of value. For example, BidSketch may only have one project file, for their software service product. I, as a consultant, would have a large number of projects since I work with a number of different clients. Why should I, a self employed consultant, be charged more than a company that pulls in millions of revenue every year?</p>

<h3>Good Artists Borrow, Great Artists Steal</h3>

<p>When it comes to pricing, there is no need to get creative.  There is a reason so many software as a service pricing pages look the same. <strong>Because it works.</strong> Every one would not do it if it wasn’t effective. If I was going to create a product aimed ad freelancers and agencies, I would look at competing and complementary products, and set up a very similar model. I may even use BidSketch’s exact same three tiers. The reason is that if I want to get into this space, BidSketch has done me a <strong>huge</strong> favor:</p>

<h4><em>They have found and validated a price that the market will bear.</em></h4>

<p>Usually finding a working pricing model requires lots of research and experimentation. However, to every one who wants to build a proposal tool, BidSketch has done them a huge favor. Thanks BidSketch! Some times people have a product idea, and get discouraged because it’s “been done”. Competition is not always a bad thing. Competition can be a sign that something works. On the other side of that coin, if you come up with a seemingly obvious idea that no one has done yet, it’s worth pausing for a moment and considering why you are the only person to show up to that particular party.</p>

<p>Pricing models don’t need to be original. They need to be effective at converting sales and maximizing customer value. Save your creativity for your actual product.</p>

<p><small class='notice'><em>This post originally appeared on <a href="http://www.concordantsolutions.com">Concordant Solutions</a>. Read <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/07/29/why-i-am-killing-my-company-blog/">why it moved</a>.</em></small></p>

<p>There is an insidious type of content out there on the internet, that is easy to waste time on. It’s what I call “entreporn”, and it isn’t only a waste of time to people, it is actively <strong>harmful</strong> to aspiring entrepreneurs.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>What is Entreporn?</h3>

<p>I define entrepornography as any article that focuses on start-ups that have had some kind of crazy, fluke amount of success. Reading about snapchat was offered $3 billion dollars by Facebook but had the guts to say no. Some college kid built a web app and made $20,000 in sales while he was passed out from a bender. At least 60% of whatever is on the front page of Hacker News whenever you read this post. These pieces are salacious and exciting. They get us to imagine a world where we can take an idea all the way to top and create a hugely successful venture. It’s truely the american dream!</p>

<h3>What&#8217;s the Problem</h3>

<p>The problem is that the stories they like to tell are flukes. It inspires people who want to be “The next Facebook”. The problem is that no one is going to be the next Facebook. No one is going to have the same conditions that Mark Zuckerburg did. Even if they did, any company requires a lot of luck, especially to get to the place Facebook is at today. And besides, I never understood why Twitter didn’t get to take “The next Facebook”  crown and keep it.</p>

<p>These articles can’t teach you anything, because they tell stories of companies that aren’t repeatable. I’m not asking that you stop reading articles on the internet, because it would make me quite the hypocritical writer. But also because there is a ton of good, valuable advice out there you could be reading instead.</p>

<h3>Why It&#8217;s Harmful</h3>

<p>However, the time wasting is not the worst part about this. As I said, I consider entreporn <strong>harmful</strong>. It’s toxic. It, much like regular pornography, gives inexperienced people a skewed view of what reality is like. Entreporn gives people the idea that they can pursue any idea, and hit it big. It gives people the impressions that start ups are like the lottery, except that they are willing to buy a single ticket with thousands of dollars and years of their life.</p>

<p>I don’t want to discourage anyone from being an entrepreneur, in fact I would encourage anyone interested to learn more about it. However, I would encourage these people to learn how to be an entrepreneur in <em>the real world</em>, not the fantasy land that TechCrunch likes to paint. Very few people can build “The next Facebook”, but a <strong>whole lot</strong> of people can build a sustainable, profitable business. and reading these vain articles is actively preventing people from doing so.</p>

<p>I don’t want to read about the guy who got 10,000 subscribers in a weekend. I’ll never be that guy. I want to read about the guy that got 100 and how he did it. That’s educational. That’s actionable. That’s <strong>real</strong>. Startups are not exempt from the being businesses, and the rules of business that have existed for hundreds of years still apply. By learning about how to build your business realistically, you have a much lower risk and higher chance of success.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Increase Engagement And Conversions When People Sign Up For Your Email List</h3>

<p><img class="left" src="http://glennstovall.com/images/articles/drip.jpg" width="260"></p>

<p><small class='notice'><em>This post originally appeared on <a href="http://www.concordantsolutions.com">Concordant Solutions</a>. Read <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/07/29/why-i-am-killing-my-company-blog/">why it moved</a>.</em></small></p>

<p>When building a mailing list, engagement is highest within the first two to three weeks of the person joining the list. However, these people usually get the same content that everyone else on your list getting. Wouldn’t it be great if you could send them content that was optimized for this situation. That’s what <strong>drip email campaigns</strong> are for.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>What are Drip Email Campaigns?</h3>

<p>Drip email campaigns are email campaigns that are sent out based on when a subscriber has performed an action instead of being scheduled on a calendar date. While a regular email list campaign may be scheduled to go out on June 1st, 2014 at 1pm, A drip email campaign will be scheduled to be sent out 3 days after a sign up.</p>

<p>Drip marketing campaigns are usually several emails in length. We want to reach out to a person multiple times (but too much, don’t be obnoxious) when they have first joined our list.</p>

<h3>Playing the Long Game</h3>

<p>No matter what you are selling, you are always selling people trust to some degree. People need to believe in your product and believe that you are capable of solving their problem before they will be willing to pay you money to do so. You can’t really build a whole lot of trust on social media or on a landing page. However, it takes much less trust to get someone’s email address, and from there you will have several opportunities to reach out to this person and build trust.</p>

<h3>How to Structure Your Campaign</h3>

<p>The most important thing about your campaign is that you need it to be helpful and valuable to your new subscriber. Your posts need to be mostly selfless. If you run a mailing list and all you do is sell to them, then you are doing it wrong, and it will drive people away. By selling directly less, you will build more trust, and make more sales in the end.</p>

<p>My personal rule is that your helpful content should have a minimum 2:1 ratio of being helpful, and being a sales email. Also, you should mix up between “hard sells” and “soft sells”. A hard sell is an email where the entire point is to get the user to complete a transaction. A soft sell is a message that is still valuable, but contains a subtle message.  For example, I may write an email about how to use lifecycle emails to increase conversions, and follow it up with “And by the way, this is something I love helping clients with. hit ‘reply’ if you would like to talk about us working together.”</p>

<p>Following those rules, here is what a drip campaign might look like:</p>

<ol>
<li>An introductory email.</li>
<li>An educational email.</li>
<li>An education email with a soft sell.</li>
<li>1 -2 more educational emails.</li>
<li>A hard sell.</li>
</ol>


<p>You can change this as you see fit, just stick to the 2:1 ratio.</p>

<h3>Your First Campaign</h3>

<p>If you have done any writing before, you can set your first campaign set up  quickly. Go find 4 – 5 of your best email campaigns or blog posts, and spread them out over 2 -4 weeks. You now have a campaign! This way you are giving your new subscribers your best content at a point when they are most engaged, making this some of the most effective email marketing you can do.</p>

<h3>Using Drip Campaigns as an Incentive</h3>

<p>Which do you think is a better call to action to get people to join a mailing list?</p>

<ul>
<li>Sign up for my newsletter.</li>
<li>Enter your email address and I will give you something for free.</li>
</ul>


<p>I recently wrote a <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/05/09/freelance-pricing-handbook-launch-post-mortem/">case study</a> about how I used a free eBook in order to jump start one of my lists. You can use your drip campaign as the incentive by framing it as a service. For example, you may have a 30-day course that can teach your potential clients how to do something. ConvertKit is a drip marketing tool that does this on their first page. Since the service revolves around building forms to get people to sign up, they have a <a href="https://convertkit.com/">30 day course on creating forms that convert</a>.</p>

<h3>Tools for Drip Campaigns</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Mailchimp Autoresponders</strong> : Mailchimp doesn’t have any tools built specifically for drip marketing campaigns, but they do have autoresponders, which you can use to set one up. You can set an autoresponder to be sent out X days after someone joins a list, so you can create a drip campaign by creating several autoresponders.</li>
<li><strong>Drip</strong>: As you can tell my the name, Drip is designed specifically for creating drip campaigns. It also integrates well with other email list providers, so if you want to use Drip for your campaigns and Mailchimp or AWeber for your list management, you can do that.</li>
<li><strong>ConvertKit</strong>: ConvertKit is what I have been using lately. It has support for list management, drip campaigns, and offering sign-up incentives.</li>
</ul>


<p>By using drip campaigns, you can have a long form message that you can deliver to every single person that expresses interest in whatever it is your offering. If you have ever done sales where you had to have several emails or phone calls back and forth with a potential client, then you how time consuming that can be. Drip campaigns allow you to automate this process with the people that are in a situation where they are most likely to convert.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Get Better Information From The Same Data</h3>

<p><img class="left" src="http://glennstovall.com/images/articles/analytics.jpg" width="260"></p>

<p><small class='notice'><em>This post originally appeared on <a href="http://www.concordantsolutions.com">Concordant Solutions</a>. Read <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/07/29/why-i-am-killing-my-company-blog/">why it moved</a>.</em></small></p>

<p>It’s important to track metrics in your business. Tracking metrics means that you can make decisions based on numbers and cold hard facts instead of guessing and gut feelings. But not all metrics are created equal, and not all ways of tracking metrics are creating equal. If you are looking at the wrong numbers, then you could end up making disastrous decisions. Let’s take a look at the best ways to track metrics, and the most important numbers you need to be keeping an eye on.</p>

<!-- more -->




<div style='clear:both;'></div>


<h3>Metrics by Time</h3>

<p>You want to look at metrics in units of time. “Grand total” type metrics, such as total number of Facebook followers, doesn’t tell you anything about the current standing of your business. In this example, you would want to look at “new Facebook followers per month” instead. This way you can see how you are doing at your key performance indicators <em>right now</em>.</p>

<h3>Metrics by Change</h3>

<p>What’s even better than looking at metrics is weekly or monthly units, is looking at the comparison of those units. Even better than “new Facebook followers per month” would to compare this month’s number to last month’s number, and come up with a new metric, “% change in new Facebook followers”. This is the number where you want to move the meter. This shows the rate of growth inside your company.</p>

<p>This is one of those times in life where calculus is actually useful. By looking at these numbers, you are looking at the velocity and acceleration of your business. If you are driving a car and want to reach your destination faster, you don’t look at how many miles you have traveled, you look at your miles per hour (a metric over time), and put the pedal in the medal in order to increase your miles per hour over time (a metric by change).</p>

<h3>Three Primary Metrics</h3>

<p>There are three primary metrics that every business, no matter how large or small, no matter how tech-savvy or old-school, should be looking at:</p>

<ul>
<li>Leads: The number of potential customers you are making contact with each month.</li>
<li>Conversions: What percentage of those leads are you able to convert into paying customers?</li>
<li>Profit: Is your business making enough money to be viable. Profit is just the child of two other important metrics, Revenue and Expenses, which are both important in their own right.</li>
</ul>


<p>I’m not saying these are the only things worth tracking, but if you don’t know these numbers then this would be a good place to start. It’s better to focus on a few important metrics than many unimportant ones. While keeping up with numbers is a good thing, you don’t want to drown out the signal with a lot of noise.</p>

<h3>Vanity Metrics</h3>

<p>There are a number of metrics that you probably actively avoid tracking in order to prevent you from making bad decisions. If you tracked number of sales of a certain type of product, but the cost of a sale of that product caused you to lose money on it, then you would end up trying to increase the units sold, and eventually end up in the poor house
. Here are some examples of numbers that are not worth wasting your time on:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Registered Users</strong>: Getting users to try a new service once is easy. Getting users to stay is something else altogether.</li>
<li><strong>Pageviews</strong>: Pageviews can be easily manipulated, and are worth very little. It also doesn’t tell you about the quality of the traffic. I would rather have 10 visits from potential clients than 1,000 visits from people from Hacker News who happened to like a blog article.</li>
<li><strong>Likes</strong> Unless your business is heavily focused in the social media space, I wouldn’t put a lot of weight on how many likes, shares, retweets, and so on your company gets. These are like pageviews but another step removed and that much more worthless.</li>
</ul>


<p>These are called vanity metrics because they make you feel good. However, none of these are actionable and don’t have any impact on the bottom line of your business. Don’t get caught up in trying to move these numbers much.</p>

<h3>Further Watching</h3>

<p>If you’d like to learn more about metrics, what to watch and how to watch them, Ben Yoskovitz gave a talk called “Lean Analytics: How to Focus on What Matters” Which is available for free online. I highly recommend it:</p>

<p>I have recently been working on using Nathan Barry’s app <a href="http://www.convertkit.com">ConvertKit</a> to set up some new email marketing tools, and It wasn’t immediately clear to me how to  import users, so I sent him an email asking how to do this. In 15 minutes, I get a response that he had just put this up:</p>

<div style='clear:both;'></div>


<p><img class="center" src="http://glennstovall.com/images/articles/convertkit.png"></p>

<p>A <a href="https://convertkit.com/2014/import-email-subscribers/">whole blog post</a>, written just for me! I thought it was an impressive effort, and a very quick turnaround. But this is also a good example of another good customer service strategy:  Using your blog as your manual / help desk.</p>

<p>Not only did Nathan reach out to me personally, he has a piece of content that accomplishes several other goals:</p>

<ul>
<li>It highlights a feature of his application: ConvertKit can import subscribers from your other applications.</li>
<li>It gives him a public piece of content with good keywords, which is good for SEO.</li>
<li>If anyone else has the same issue, they may either find this article, or Nathan can just send them a link. Either way, it automates a part of the customer support process, which saves time.</li>
<li>It impressed one person so much they decided to blog about it :)</li>
</ul>


<p> If you are looking for ways to make your customer support more effective and efficient, you could do a lot worse than doing something like this.</p>

<p><a href="http://john.do/">John Saddington</a> gave a talk in February for <a href="http://www.meetup.com/transform-athens/">Transform Athens</a> called “Blogging and your Future”.

It was published on Youtube and had a view count way lower than it deserved, so I wanted to share it here:</p>

<p>I’m a big proponent of writing as a tool for not only marketing, but for education and communication as well. I’ve written some more on writing in a couple of other places. I’ve talked on my personal blog about <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/03/05/personal-blogging-vs-professional-blogging/">why I share some things on my personal site and some here on my company site</a>. I’ve also written on here on how you shouldn’t stop at blogging, but how you should form an entire <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/08/01/from-blogging-to-content-strategy/">content strategy</a>.</p>
