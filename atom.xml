<p><img src="http://glennstovall.com/images/articles/simple_long.jpg"></p>

<p>In design, I&#8217;ve always been a fan of minimalism. Minimalism is a philosophy about boiling things down to their essential elements. It&#8217;s about having a philosophy of &#8220;less but better&#8221;. Great thinkers from all walks of life have touted the benefits of this kind of approach:</p>

<p>There is a universal truth that drives all of these musicians, artists, and visionaries. They all speak of the beauty and elegance of simplicity in all things. As entrepreneurs, we have the power to design not only our businesses, but our entire lives. However, many people end up working long hours, taking on lots of stress, and doing physical and mental harm to ourselves.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>My Email Marketing Strategy In a Nutshell</h3>

<p>Email marketing converts better than social media or content marketing. Nathan Barry has a great <a href="http://nathanbarry.com/email-marketing/">write up with the numbers</a>. You can build a list by <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/08/04/start-using-drip-email-campaigns-today/">giving people  incentives in exchange for their email address</a>, reaching out to them directly, or offering people updates on as-yet-unreleased new product. But once you have built that list, how do you write emails that people on that list will actually want to read?</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>Drop The Newsletters and start writing emails</h3>

<p>Newsletters are usually ignored and end up right in the trash bin.  Instead of thinking of your emails to your list as newsletters, I want you to approach them like you would writing an email to one person. When I write email drafts, I will usually start with the line &#8216;Hey Bob,&#8217;, where Bob is a real person I know. If I write with a more personal tone in mind, it will show in the final result. Your formatting needs to match this more personal tone, so no more fancy email themes..</p>

<h3>7 Steps to Formatting Your Email</h3>

<h4>1.Remove all formatting.</h4>

<p>Your email should look just like you sent it from your GMail or Mailbox account. This means that you don&#8217;t want any of the formatting that  email list providers offer. However, you don&#8217;t want to send a plain text email either. Plain text takes away some key formatting tools, such as <strong>bolding</strong>, <em>italicizing</em>, and <a href="#">putting in links</a>.</p>

<h4>2. Write your subject line like you would a regular email.</h4>

<p>Don&#8217;t title case your headline. Capitalize the first word, and then write the rest lowercase. Using questions in your subject line is a good way to increase open rates, but can become annoying if over used.</p>

<h4>3.Set the From Address to Your Address, and Encourage Replies.</h4>

<p>Emails are conversations, and conversations are a two-way street. The from address should be from your personal address if possible, and if not, one that you check and respond too frequently. Your subscribers should be able to reply to any of your emails and expect a response (it may not be obvious this is the case since the email is automated).</p>

<h4>4.Start with a salutation.</h4>

<p>If possible, capture the first name of people when they sign up for your list. This will allow you to start with a line like &#8216;Hey [first_name]&#8217;. A person&#8217;s name is their favorite word to hear, and it starts your email off on the right foot.</p>

<h4>5.Write short body copy.</h4>

<p>Some people like to send out entire articles in their email list. Personally, I don&#8217;t like this approach and haven&#8217;t had much success. If I have a lot to say, I will publish a larger article elsewhere, and include a short description in the email. I like to provide something extra to my subscribers, so I will usually provide additional examples or a personal story in the email.</p>

<h4>6.End with a friendly signature.</h4>

<p>I always sign my emails with &#8220;cheers, Glenn&#8221;. Much like the salutation, This gives the letter a more personal feel.</p>

<h4>7.Often, but not always, include a PS.</h4>

<p>The post script is one of the most read part of the email, after the subject line and the first paragraph. Even if people don&#8217;t want to read the rest of your email, they will check out the PS. In old letter writing, the &#8216;PS&#8217; was where people would include something <em>so good</em> that they just couldn&#8217;t leave it out. Your PS should only be a couple sentences long, and get straight to the point.</p>

<h3>The 3 Types of Emails to Send</h3>

<p>When writing emails to your list, there are three formats that I use:</p>

<h4>1.The Value Email.</h4>

<p>This email has no ulterior motive. This is simply an email that provides value to your list. You can provide value by offering something educational, useful, or entertaining to your list. <strong>you do not sell to your list.</strong> If someone was nice enough to sign up for your list, they deserve value from you in return. This is where you give it to them.</p>

<h4>2.The Soft Sell Email.</h4>

<p>The soft sell email is identical to the value email, with one small difference: You mention something you are selling as a secondary point in the email. The PS is a great place to do this. You can write a valuable article, then in the PS include a call to action. Now when I say &#8220;sale&#8221;, I don&#8217;t always mean that you are asking the people on your list to give you money in exchange for goods or services. A &#8220;sale&#8221; is anytime you are asking them to give up something of value in exchange for something of equal or greater value. When people sign up for your list, that was a sale. They exchanged access to their inbox for valuable information. In addition to selling products, you could ask them to sign up for a free trial, ask them a question, or ask them to attend an event such as a webinar.</p>

<h4>3.The Hard Sell Email.</h4>

<p>These emails have one goal: To get your users to buy something you are selling. Like the soft sell email, that sale could be anything from a transaction to a webinar sign-up. Use these <strong>sparingly</strong>.</p>

<h3>The Frequency of Emails</h3>

<p>I send out emails once a week, sometimes every two weeks. If you email your list more frequently than that, they may become fatigued. Some people push their list harder, and this is something that depends on your audience.</p>

<p>The only time I break this rule is when I am launching a new product or have an upcoming event. I will ramp up the emails to build anticipation for the event, and usually send reminders a week before, a day before, and even an hour before.</p>

<p>When it comes to email frequency, you should also be mindful of the frequency you use the three templates above. The hard sell email is OK sometimes, but if that is all you send, you will not keep your subscribers for long. My general rule of thumb is to keep a 2:1 ratio for helpful, valuable emails, and sales emails. Here is a 6-email rotation I tend to use:</p>

<ul>
<li>Value email</li>
<li>Value email</li>
<li>Soft sell email</li>
<li>Value email</li>
<li>Value email</li>
<li>Hard sell email</li>
</ul>


<p>That way, once I have gotten to the point where I am selling someone, I have already provided them a lot of value. This also means that I am only sending out sales emails once every 5 - 6 weeks. It may seem odd to spend a lot of time building a list and then sell to it so infrequently, but by taking this approach those sales emails are much more likely to get responses.</p>

<h3>Segment Your List As Much As Possible</h3>

<p>So far, all of this has been about making your emails more personalized. Doesn&#8217;t it seem strange to be more &#8216;personal&#8217;, and then send the same email to your entire list? It&#8217;s true, and one way to get around this is <em>segmentation.</em> Segmentation means that you break your list up based on past behavior, and sent broadcasts to smaller segments of your list. For example, if you are selling a certain product, it doesn&#8217;t make sense to keep sending emails to those people asking them to buy that product. Instead, you could only send them valuable emails, ask them for feedback on the product, or sell them something else.</p>

<h3>Email Tools that Provide Segmentation</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.convertkit.com">ConvertKit</a>.</strong> I&#8217;ve mentioned ConvertKit before, as it is the email tool I currently use. They recently revamped their segmenting, and allow you to segment on users based on which email capture form they signed up for.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.getdrip.com">Drip</a>.</strong> Drip has moved from being an email list management tool to a full on marketing automation tool. They provide user tagging, and a lot of triggers that you can use to segment your audience.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.mailchimp.com">MailChimp</a>.</strong> Mailchimp recently released a whole new <a href="http://mailchimp.com/features/automation/">suite of automation tools</a>. These are new and I haven&#8217;t tried them yet, but it looks promising. MailChimp is what a lot of people use already, so if this is you, you have a whole new set of toys to play with.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.infusionsoft.com">InfusionSoft</a>.</strong> InfusionSoft is the most powerful and most complex tool ons the market. They have a large start up cost (in the 4 figures), but they have a lot of tools and integration they make them the most in-depth marketing automation system out there.</li>
</ul>


<p>This is my entire email marketing strategy in a nutshell. By following these formulas, you can keep your list more engaged, and build a strong audience that is invested in you and your brand.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Personal vs. Professional Blogging part III</h3>

<p>Should you write under your personal name, or under a company brand? I&#8217;ve addressed this question in other articles. At first, I planned on starting two blogs (<a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/03/05/personal-blogging-vs-professional-blogging/">part I</a>). I tried that for a while and realized that I was spending a lot of time trying to build two audiences when I could just be building one. The time invested was not paying off. So, I decided to combine my two blogs, and write everything under my personal name (<a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/07/29/why-i-am-killing-my-company-blog/">part II</a>). Today I&#8217;m covering a third option: Instead of writing under your name or your company, you write about a particular subject on a niche blog.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>Niche Blogging</h3>

<p>A niche blog is a blog that is centered around a certain  topic, instead of around you or your company. The goal of a niche blog is to educate and inform its audience. For example, if your potential customers ran a SaaS business, you would have a site that was dedicated to writing articles to help SaaS owners.</p>

<h3>Using Niches to Sell Products</h3>

<p>Brennan Dunn recently made a shift to writing a subject focused site instead of a personal or company one. Over the past couple years, Brennan had a podcast which lived on his personal domain <a href="http://brennandunn.com">brennandunn.com</a>. Whenever he wrote an article, he would publish it on the blog of his software product, <a href="http://www.planscope.io">Planscope</a>.</p>

<p>Brennan recently decided to change how he was publishing content. He created a new site <a href="http://doubleyourfreelancing.com">doubleyourfreelancing.com</a>, and moved all of his content over to that site. His content is based around selling to freelancers, and this site is all about growing your freelancing business. He got the name from one of his most popular products, <em>Double Your Freelancing Rate</em>.</p>

<h3>Using Niche Writing to Get Clients</h3>

<p>By building a site around a certain subject, you position yourself as an authority in that subject. A friend of mine, Denny Cave, works exclusively on the LightCMS platform. He has a site called <a href="http://www.lightignite.com">LightIgnite</a> , which is all about developing on the LightCMS platform. By doing this, he puts himself in the position of being <strong>THE</strong> LightCMS guy, and this brings him a lot of client work.</p>

<h3>Are You Changing Your Blogging Strategy Again?</h3>

<p>No. This time, I&#8217;m not changing how I am doing anything, But I think that this is a strategy worth talking about, and worth considering if you are looking for a new way to publish your content, grow an audience, and make more sales.</p>

<p>In web development, the group of software, frameworks, and tools is called our &#8220;stack&#8221;. In businesses, you have a similar &#8220;stack&#8221;, which is made up of the tools and systems that you use to run your business. Today I wanted to list out my personal stack that I use.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Sales and Lead Management: PipeDrive</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.pipedrive.com">Pipedrive</a> has the best visualization of the sales pipeline I have seen, and it can be completely customized. But the most valuable feature is that every time you finish a task that is related to a deal, it will automatically prompt you to create another. This way you never forget to follow up with a potential client, and deals don&#8217;t fall through the cracks.</p>

<h2>Contracts: Docracy</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.docracy.com">Docracy</a> is a free resource for open source contract templates. It also has e-signatures, so you can use it to get contracts signed with remote clients. Here a couple of templates that I either use, or have my own modified version of:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.docracy.com/649dkpe7g9/contract-killer-3">General Work Contract</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.docracy.com/0i2fahvpv5t/statement-of-work-digital-advertising-services">Statement of Work</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.docracy.com/27/generic-shortform-nda">Generic Short Form NDA</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>Invoicing: FreshBooks</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.freshbooks.com">Freshbooks</a> is one of the largest invoicing tools out there. It makes generating invoices simple. Freshbooks is great if you bill by the hour, however since I moving away from that billing structure I have found Freshbooks to be a bit lacking. It doesn&#8217;t really have support for daily and weekly billing. But it does have simple time tracking, expense tracking, online payments, and really good reporting. I do appreciate that when tax time rolls around, I can print out a couple reports, hand them to my CPA, and boom. Done.</p>

<h2>Customer Support: ZenDesk</h2>

<p>When I was looking for a customer support tool, my one requirement was that it had to work 100% via email for clients. Clients are busy and don&#8217;t want to have to learn a new tool just because they found a bug. <a href="http://zendesk.com">Zendesk</a> met this requirement. My clients can send all inquiries to a support email address, and I can keep track of conversations and tickets via the application. When working with clients on monthly retainers, this is a great tool to keep things organized.</p>

<h2>Scheduling: Calendly + Google Calendar</h2>

<p>I hate having to go back and forth via email to schedule an appointment with someone. With <a href="http://www.calendly.com">Calendly</a>, I can send people a calendar of my availability, and they can select the time that works best for them. The real &#8220;killer feature&#8221; for me is the Google calendar integration: Not only does it add events to my calendar, it will automatically remove my availability if I schedule something else in that time slot, even if it wasn&#8217;t through Calendly.</p>

<h2>Writing Articles: Draft</h2>

<p><a href="https://draftin.com/">Draft</a> is a new tool I&#8217;ve started using recently. I love the clean interface and how easy it is to share drafts with people. I&#8217;ve been using to send some beta versions of chapters for my book project <em>Professional Freelance</em>. It also has a &#8216;Hemingway mode&#8217;, which disables the backspace and delete buttons for you. This makes the writing experience similar to writing on a typewriter, which is helpful when writing first drafts, and keeps you out of slipping into editing mode.</p>

<h2>Writing Books &amp; Courses: Scrivener</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php">Scrivener</a> is like Photoshop for words. It allows you to break your writing project in nested sections, and move them around freely. This way, moving chapters and sections around are easy. When I first began to attempt to write a book, I figured I would write an outline, and then fill it out. As the project went on, I&#8217;ve completely rearranged the books three times. Sometimes entire chapters are deleted, and whole new ones are added. Scrivener makes this process a breeze.</p>

<h2>Publishing: OctoPress + WordPress + Medium</h2>

<p>I have a few different tools that I use to publish content online:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> Octopress is the site you are reading right now. It&#8217;s a static site generator. That means that instead of having software like WordPress installed on a server, I generate the pages on my local machine, and put the result online. This way, there are no load times, and no worry of hacking because there is nothing to hack.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> WordPress is the granddaddy of online publishing, and I use it for my company site <a href="http://www.concordantsolutions.com">Concordant Solutions</a>. WordPress can be a bit unwieldy at times, but it does make publishing simple, and it&#8217;s impossible to beat the ecosystem around it. All of the plugins and themes available make it easy to get something set up quickly.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://medium.com">Medium</a> is a very slick looking online publishing platform. It was created by Ev Williams, one of the founders of Twitter. Medium is focused on longer form content and providing the best reading and writing experience for its users. The benefit of Medium is that it helps you reach out to new audiences. When I&#8217;m not writing here, I&#8217;m writing there. In fact, I am considering moving more of my writing over to Medium in the future.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Email Marketing: ConvertKit</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.convertkit.com">ConvertKit</a> is responsible for all those little calls to action at the bottom of each post. ConvertKit has a different approach from other mailing list providers. Instead of just putting everyone onto one list, you create different forms. These forms usually come with an incentive, such as a download or a course. Then, you can segment users based on which form they signed up for. This allows you to send more targeted emails.</p>

<p>In addition to forms that you can embed, ConvertKit also allows you to build landing pages which can then be embedded on your site. I also like the simple look of the emails. I hate the idea of &#8220;newsletters&#8221;. I view my list as communication at scale. ConvertKit is just an easy way to email a few hundred people and start some conversations. All the emails come from my email address so that you can hit &#8220;reply&#8221; to get in touch with me. And I always write back. If you want to see what one of their landing pages looks like and/or sign up for my list, <a href="https://app.convertkit.com/concordant/letters">Here is the link</a></p>

    <link href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/09/03/30-day-blogging-challenge/"/>
    <updated>2014-09-03T14:15:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/09/03/30-day-blogging-challenge</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Come Ship More Content in September With Me</h3>

<p>I heard about this challenge that a friend of a friend is doing: blog every weekday for 30 days. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://cdevroe.com/blog/9527/blogging-every-weekday-for-30-days">the original post</a>. Here&#8217;s the post where I <a href="http://mattdsmith.com/30-day-blog-challenge/">heard about it</a>. I know writing is a valuable skill. Blogging can help you build your reach, prove your authority, and give you an way to provide value to your potential clients and customers by providing them with educational content.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>However, I want to modify this challenge a bit, just because I kind of hate the term &#8220;blogging&#8221;. Blogging is just one way to deliver content, there are several others. Instead, I want to take on the &#8220;30-day publishing challenge&#8221;. Under my rules, any of the following will count as my writing for the day:</p>

<h3>What Counts</h3>

<ul>
<li>Publishing a new blog post. This includes my personal site or sites such as Medium.</li>
<li>Publishing a new letter to people on my mailing list (yep, this is my Day 1)</li>
<li>Publishing a new page or re-writing an existing page on my personal or company site.</li>
<li>Publishing another form of long-form content, such as an email course, eBook, or PDF.
Here are things that don&#8217;t count:</li>
</ul>


<h3>What Doesn&#8217;t Count</h3>

<ul>
<li>Republishing existing content in a new form (I&#8217;ve been looking into using Quora&#8217;s and LinkedIn&#8217;s publishing platforms to get more reach)</li>
<li>Super short-form content (tweets, tumbles, facebook posts, etc.)</li>
</ul>


<p>Since I&#8217;m bending the rules a bit, I&#8217;m going to publish something every 30 days instead of just on weekdays. This also means that for the weekends I&#8217;ll probably write three things on Friday and space them out over the weekend.</p>

<p>So you up to taking the challenge? If  <a href="http://www.glennstovall.com/contact">drop me a line</a>. I&#8217;d love to follow along with what you are doing.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://glennstovall.com/images/articles/bidsketch_pricing_full.png" width="260"></p>

<p><small class='notice'><em>This post originally appeared on <a href="http://www.concordantsolutions.com">Concordant Solutions</a>. Read <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/07/29/why-i-am-killing-my-company-blog/">why it moved</a>.</em></small></p>

<p>You may have noticed that on many software as a service pricing pages, they tend to look the same. There are always a few plans, usually 3, and they middle is <strong>always</strong> the most popular. This isn’t an accident. This is all designed to get the maximum value out of a customer. Let’s take a look at one company’s pricing model and why it is effective.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img class="center" src="http://glennstovall.com/images/articles/bidsketch_pricing_full.png"></p>

<p>I got this table from <a href="http://www.bidsketch.com/pricing/">BidSketch’s pricing page</a>. BidSketch is a tool that helps freelancers and agencies write and send winning proposals. This table is important to BidSketch. Literally every single customer, and therefore every single dollar, comes from this page. Nothing in this table is an accident. Let’s take a look at the plan names:</p>

<h3>Customer Segmentation</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="http://glennstovall.com/images/articles/bidsketch-segmentation.png"></p>

<p>you’ll notice that BidSketch doesn’t call it’s plans “small/medium/large”, or “bronze/silver/gold” or anything generic like that. Instead, they know that they have different kinds of customers, and that those customers are willing to pay different rates. They aim at three of their types of clients: individual freelancers, small studios, and large agencies.</p>

<p>Why do they charge agencies more money? Because agencies get more value out of BidSketch than freelancers. The proposals that large agencies are sending out are an order of magnitude larger than the one a freelancer is sending out.</p>

<p>This is the most important part of pricing any service or product: <strong>when the customer gets more value out of your product or service, you need to be getting more value from that customer.</strong> Doing this aligns your incentives with the customer’s. This means that now you and the customer are a team. Since you make money off of your customer being successful, you will do everything you can to help your customer. Since BidSketch knows that if they help their customers make more money by helping them write better proposals, they are going to do everything they can to make the best proposal tool out there? It’s a win-win for everybody.</p>

<h3>Pricing Ratio</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="http://glennstovall.com/images/articles/bidsketch-pricing.png"></p>

<p>Firstly, you’ll notice that BidSketch put their highest price package first. This is an old-school marketing trick. By looking at the initial plan first, the $79 and $29 plans will feel much cheaper in comparison. The highest selling price plan is almost never the highest selling one, it is mostly their for comparison. This is called <em>price anchoring.</em></p>

<p>You also want to have a decent ratio between your prices. If their prices were $29 / $39 / $49, they aren’t getting much extra value out of the plans. In fact, <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ryandelk/micro-conf-final">Ryan Delk at Gumroad</a> has looked at all the sales of digital products, and has found the optimal ratios for tiered pricing:</p>

<h4><em>1x 2.2x 5x</em></h4>

<p>Where ‘X’ is the base cost of your service. You’ll see that BidSketch follows this ratio closely: $79 = 2.7x , $149 = 5.1x . Note that ratio is just an approximation, and you don’t have to follow it exactly.  <em>(I don’t think BidSketch would get the same revenue with a $29 /  $63.80  / $145 model)</em></p>

<h3>Approximating Value</h3>

<p><img class="center" src="http://glennstovall.com/images/articles/bidsketch-features.png"></p>

<p>I said before that the best way to split up your pricing is to align your values with the customer’s. BidSketch could do this directly if they wanted too, and base their pricing on how the total dollar value of proposals that you close each month (payment processors such as <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> and <a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/">Briaintree</a> have the easiest alignment ever. They just get 2.7% of the revenue you bring in). In other cases, you may not have a way of directly knowing how valuable your service is to a client. In that case, you want to approximate the value. You do this by tying your pricing to something that is correlated to value. BidSketch does this in two ways: the number of users, and the amount of storage. Instead of looking a dollar value, they are looking at three things with these features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Number of employees / contractors you have working for you.</li>
<li>The number of proposals you are sending out.</li>
<li>The quality of proposals you are sending out. (i.e. using more photos &amp; videos, hence more storage)</li>
</ul>


<p>A company that has multiple people (agencies, studios) have to be making payroll, which means they are almost always making more money. That’s why you see a lot of software as a service products segment on number of users. One of the things that has held me back from hiring an assistant is I know the minute I have one employee my monthly software bill would shoot up a few hundred dollars a month.</p>

<p>There are two version control services that software developers use: <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">BitBucket</a>. A version control service is a place where developers can store and collaborate on code. BitBucket increases prices based number of users, but GitHub prices based on number of projects. I feel like GitHub missed the mark on this pricing. Number of projects is a false approximation of value. For example, BidSketch may only have one project file, for their software service product. I, as a consultant, would have a large number of projects since I work with a number of different clients. Why should I, a self employed consultant, be charged more than a company that pulls in millions of revenue every year?</p>

<h3>Good Artists Borrow, Great Artists Steal</h3>

<p>When it comes to pricing, there is no need to get creative.  There is a reason so many software as a service pricing pages look the same. <strong>Because it works.</strong> Every one would not do it if it wasn’t effective. If I was going to create a product aimed ad freelancers and agencies, I would look at competing and complementary products, and set up a very similar model. I may even use BidSketch’s exact same three tiers. The reason is that if I want to get into this space, BidSketch has done me a <strong>huge</strong> favor:</p>

<h4><em>They have found and validated a price that the market will bear.</em></h4>

<p>Usually finding a working pricing model requires lots of research and experimentation. However, to every one who wants to build a proposal tool, BidSketch has done them a huge favor. Thanks BidSketch! Some times people have a product idea, and get discouraged because it’s “been done”. Competition is not always a bad thing. Competition can be a sign that something works. On the other side of that coin, if you come up with a seemingly obvious idea that no one has done yet, it’s worth pausing for a moment and considering why you are the only person to show up to that particular party.</p>

<p>Pricing models don’t need to be original. They need to be effective at converting sales and maximizing customer value. Save your creativity for your actual product.</p>

<p><small class='notice'><em>This post originally appeared on <a href="http://www.concordantsolutions.com">Concordant Solutions</a>. Read <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/07/29/why-i-am-killing-my-company-blog/">why it moved</a>.</em></small></p>

<p>There is an insidious type of content out there on the internet, that is easy to waste time on. It’s what I call “entreporn”, and it isn’t only a waste of time to people, it is actively <strong>harmful</strong> to aspiring entrepreneurs.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>What is Entreporn?</h3>

<p>I define entrepornography as any article that focuses on start-ups that have had some kind of crazy, fluke amount of success. Reading about snapchat was offered $3 billion dollars by Facebook but had the guts to say no. Some college kid built a web app and made $20,000 in sales while he was passed out from a bender. At least 60% of whatever is on the front page of Hacker News whenever you read this post. These pieces are salacious and exciting. They get us to imagine a world where we can take an idea all the way to top and create a hugely successful venture. It’s truely the american dream!</p>

<h3>What&#8217;s the Problem</h3>

<p>The problem is that the stories they like to tell are flukes. It inspires people who want to be “The next Facebook”. The problem is that no one is going to be the next Facebook. No one is going to have the same conditions that Mark Zuckerburg did. Even if they did, any company requires a lot of luck, especially to get to the place Facebook is at today. And besides, I never understood why Twitter didn’t get to take “The next Facebook”  crown and keep it.</p>

<p>These articles can’t teach you anything, because they tell stories of companies that aren’t repeatable. I’m not asking that you stop reading articles on the internet, because it would make me quite the hypocritical writer. But also because there is a ton of good, valuable advice out there you could be reading instead.</p>

<h3>Why It&#8217;s Harmful</h3>

<p>However, the time wasting is not the worst part about this. As I said, I consider entreporn <strong>harmful</strong>. It’s toxic. It, much like regular pornography, gives inexperienced people a skewed view of what reality is like. Entreporn gives people the idea that they can pursue any idea, and hit it big. It gives people the impressions that start ups are like the lottery, except that they are willing to buy a single ticket with thousands of dollars and years of their life.</p>

<p>I don’t want to discourage anyone from being an entrepreneur, in fact I would encourage anyone interested to learn more about it. However, I would encourage these people to learn how to be an entrepreneur in <em>the real world</em>, not the fantasy land that TechCrunch likes to paint. Very few people can build “The next Facebook”, but a <strong>whole lot</strong> of people can build a sustainable, profitable business. and reading these vain articles is actively preventing people from doing so.</p>

<p>I don’t want to read about the guy who got 10,000 subscribers in a weekend. I’ll never be that guy. I want to read about the guy that got 100 and how he did it. That’s educational. That’s actionable. That’s <strong>real</strong>. Startups are not exempt from the being businesses, and the rules of business that have existed for hundreds of years still apply. By learning about how to build your business realistically, you have a much lower risk and higher chance of success.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Increase Engagement And Conversions When People Sign Up For Your Email List</h3>

<p><img class="left" src="http://glennstovall.com/images/articles/drip.jpg" width="260"></p>

<p><small class='notice'><em>This post originally appeared on <a href="http://www.concordantsolutions.com">Concordant Solutions</a>. Read <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/07/29/why-i-am-killing-my-company-blog/">why it moved</a>.</em></small></p>

<p>When building a mailing list, engagement is highest within the first two to three weeks of the person joining the list. However, these people usually get the same content that everyone else on your list getting. Wouldn’t it be great if you could send them content that was optimized for this situation. That’s what <strong>drip email campaigns</strong> are for.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>What are Drip Email Campaigns?</h3>

<p>Drip email campaigns are email campaigns that are sent out based on when a subscriber has performed an action instead of being scheduled on a calendar date. While a regular email list campaign may be scheduled to go out on June 1st, 2014 at 1pm, A drip email campaign will be scheduled to be sent out 3 days after a sign up.</p>

<p>Drip marketing campaigns are usually several emails in length. We want to reach out to a person multiple times (but too much, don’t be obnoxious) when they have first joined our list.</p>

<h3>Playing the Long Game</h3>

<p>No matter what you are selling, you are always selling people trust to some degree. People need to believe in your product and believe that you are capable of solving their problem before they will be willing to pay you money to do so. You can’t really build a whole lot of trust on social media or on a landing page. However, it takes much less trust to get someone’s email address, and from there you will have several opportunities to reach out to this person and build trust.</p>

<h3>How to Structure Your Campaign</h3>

<p>The most important thing about your campaign is that you need it to be helpful and valuable to your new subscriber. Your posts need to be mostly selfless. If you run a mailing list and all you do is sell to them, then you are doing it wrong, and it will drive people away. By selling directly less, you will build more trust, and make more sales in the end.</p>

<p>My personal rule is that your helpful content should have a minimum 2:1 ratio of being helpful, and being a sales email. Also, you should mix up between “hard sells” and “soft sells”. A hard sell is an email where the entire point is to get the user to complete a transaction. A soft sell is a message that is still valuable, but contains a subtle message.  For example, I may write an email about how to use lifecycle emails to increase conversions, and follow it up with “And by the way, this is something I love helping clients with. hit ‘reply’ if you would like to talk about us working together.”</p>

<p>Following those rules, here is what a drip campaign might look like:</p>

<ol>
<li>An introductory email.</li>
<li>An educational email.</li>
<li>An education email with a soft sell.</li>
<li>1 -2 more educational emails.</li>
<li>A hard sell.</li>
</ol>


<p>You can change this as you see fit, just stick to the 2:1 ratio.</p>

<h3>Your First Campaign</h3>

<p>If you have done any writing before, you can set your first campaign set up  quickly. Go find 4 – 5 of your best email campaigns or blog posts, and spread them out over 2 -4 weeks. You now have a campaign! This way you are giving your new subscribers your best content at a point when they are most engaged, making this some of the most effective email marketing you can do.</p>

<h3>Using Drip Campaigns as an Incentive</h3>

<p>Which do you think is a better call to action to get people to join a mailing list?</p>

<ul>
<li>Sign up for my newsletter.</li>
<li>Enter your email address and I will give you something for free.</li>
</ul>


<p>I recently wrote a <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/05/09/freelance-pricing-handbook-launch-post-mortem/">case study</a> about how I used a free eBook in order to jump start one of my lists. You can use your drip campaign as the incentive by framing it as a service. For example, you may have a 30-day course that can teach your potential clients how to do something. ConvertKit is a drip marketing tool that does this on their first page. Since the service revolves around building forms to get people to sign up, they have a <a href="https://convertkit.com/">30 day course on creating forms that convert</a>.</p>

<h3>Tools for Drip Campaigns</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Mailchimp Autoresponders</strong> : Mailchimp doesn’t have any tools built specifically for drip marketing campaigns, but they do have autoresponders, which you can use to set one up. You can set an autoresponder to be sent out X days after someone joins a list, so you can create a drip campaign by creating several autoresponders.</li>
<li><strong>Drip</strong>: As you can tell my the name, Drip is designed specifically for creating drip campaigns. It also integrates well with other email list providers, so if you want to use Drip for your campaigns and Mailchimp or AWeber for your list management, you can do that.</li>
<li><strong>ConvertKit</strong>: ConvertKit is what I have been using lately. It has support for list management, drip campaigns, and offering sign-up incentives.</li>
</ul>


<p>By using drip campaigns, you can have a long form message that you can deliver to every single person that expresses interest in whatever it is your offering. If you have ever done sales where you had to have several emails or phone calls back and forth with a potential client, then you how time consuming that can be. Drip campaigns allow you to automate this process with the people that are in a situation where they are most likely to convert.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Get Better Information From The Same Data</h3>

<p><img class="left" src="http://glennstovall.com/images/articles/analytics.jpg" width="260"></p>

<p><small class='notice'><em>This post originally appeared on <a href="http://www.concordantsolutions.com">Concordant Solutions</a>. Read <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/07/29/why-i-am-killing-my-company-blog/">why it moved</a>.</em></small></p>

<p>It’s important to track metrics in your business. Tracking metrics means that you can make decisions based on numbers and cold hard facts instead of guessing and gut feelings. But not all metrics are created equal, and not all ways of tracking metrics are creating equal. If you are looking at the wrong numbers, then you could end up making disastrous decisions. Let’s take a look at the best ways to track metrics, and the most important numbers you need to be keeping an eye on.</p>

<!-- more -->




<div style='clear:both;'></div>


<h3>Metrics by Time</h3>

<p>You want to look at metrics in units of time. “Grand total” type metrics, such as total number of Facebook followers, doesn’t tell you anything about the current standing of your business. In this example, you would want to look at “new Facebook followers per month” instead. This way you can see how you are doing at your key performance indicators <em>right now</em>.</p>

<h3>Metrics by Change</h3>

<p>What’s even better than looking at metrics is weekly or monthly units, is looking at the comparison of those units. Even better than “new Facebook followers per month” would to compare this month’s number to last month’s number, and come up with a new metric, “% change in new Facebook followers”. This is the number where you want to move the meter. This shows the rate of growth inside your company.</p>

<p>This is one of those times in life where calculus is actually useful. By looking at these numbers, you are looking at the velocity and acceleration of your business. If you are driving a car and want to reach your destination faster, you don’t look at how many miles you have traveled, you look at your miles per hour (a metric over time), and put the pedal in the medal in order to increase your miles per hour over time (a metric by change).</p>

<h3>Three Primary Metrics</h3>

<p>There are three primary metrics that every business, no matter how large or small, no matter how tech-savvy or old-school, should be looking at:</p>

<ul>
<li>Leads: The number of potential customers you are making contact with each month.</li>
<li>Conversions: What percentage of those leads are you able to convert into paying customers?</li>
<li>Profit: Is your business making enough money to be viable. Profit is just the child of two other important metrics, Revenue and Expenses, which are both important in their own right.</li>
</ul>


<p>I’m not saying these are the only things worth tracking, but if you don’t know these numbers then this would be a good place to start. It’s better to focus on a few important metrics than many unimportant ones. While keeping up with numbers is a good thing, you don’t want to drown out the signal with a lot of noise.</p>

<h3>Vanity Metrics</h3>

<p>There are a number of metrics that you probably actively avoid tracking in order to prevent you from making bad decisions. If you tracked number of sales of a certain type of product, but the cost of a sale of that product caused you to lose money on it, then you would end up trying to increase the units sold, and eventually end up in the poor house
. Here are some examples of numbers that are not worth wasting your time on:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Registered Users</strong>: Getting users to try a new service once is easy. Getting users to stay is something else altogether.</li>
<li><strong>Pageviews</strong>: Pageviews can be easily manipulated, and are worth very little. It also doesn’t tell you about the quality of the traffic. I would rather have 10 visits from potential clients than 1,000 visits from people from Hacker News who happened to like a blog article.</li>
<li><strong>Likes</strong> Unless your business is heavily focused in the social media space, I wouldn’t put a lot of weight on how many likes, shares, retweets, and so on your company gets. These are like pageviews but another step removed and that much more worthless.</li>
</ul>


<p>These are called vanity metrics because they make you feel good. However, none of these are actionable and don’t have any impact on the bottom line of your business. Don’t get caught up in trying to move these numbers much.</p>

<h3>Further Watching</h3>

<p>If you’d like to learn more about metrics, what to watch and how to watch them, Ben Yoskovitz gave a talk called “Lean Analytics: How to Focus on What Matters” Which is available for free online. I highly recommend it:</p>

<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/70981922">Ben Yoskovitz – Lean Analytics: How to Focus on What Matters</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/user12790628">MicroConf</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a>.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://glennstovall.com/images/articles/convertkit.png" width="260"></p>

<p>I have recently been working on using Nathan Barry’s app <a href="http://www.convertkit.com">ConvertKit</a> to set up some new email marketing tools, and It wasn’t immediately clear to me how to  import users, so I sent him an email asking how to do this. In 15 minutes, I get a response that he had just put this up:</p>

<!-- more -->




<div style='clear:both;'></div>


<p><img class="center" src="http://glennstovall.com/images/articles/convertkit.png"></p>

<p>A <a href="https://convertkit.com/2014/import-email-subscribers/">whole blog post</a>, written just for me! I thought it was an impressive effort, and a very quick turnaround. But this is also a good example of another good customer service strategy:  Using your blog as your manual / help desk.</p>

<p>Not only did Nathan reach out to me personally, he has a piece of content that accomplishes several other goals:</p>

<ul>
<li>It highlights a feature of his application: ConvertKit can import subscribers from your other applications.</li>
<li>It gives him a public piece of content with good keywords, which is good for SEO.</li>
<li>If anyone else has the same issue, they may either find this article, or Nathan can just send them a link. Either way, it automates a part of the customer support process, which saves time.</li>
<li>It impressed one person so much they decided to blog about it :)</li>
</ul>


<p> If you are looking for ways to make your customer support more effective and efficient, you could do a lot worse than doing something like this.</p>

<p><a href="http://john.do/">John Saddington</a> gave a talk in February for <a href="http://www.meetup.com/transform-athens/">Transform Athens</a> called “Blogging and your Future”. It was an inspiring talk. I don’t think any talk has gotten me to move to action more so than this one. It was published on Youtube and had a view count way lower than it deserved, so I wanted to share it here:</p>

<p>I’m a big proponent of writing as a tool for not only marketing, but for education and communication as well. I’ve written some more on writing in a couple of other places. I’ve talked on my personal blog about <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/03/05/personal-blogging-vs-professional-blogging/">why I share some things on my personal site and some here on my company site</a>. I’ve also written on here on how you shouldn’t stop at blogging, but how you should form an entire <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/08/01/from-blogging-to-content-strategy/">content strategy</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Since posting this article, I&#8217;ve since changed my mind on the opinions shared above.

<p><img class="center" src="http://glennstovall.com/images/articles/spotify-iteration.jpg"></p>

<p><small class='notice'><em>This post originally appeared on <a href="http://www.concordantsolutions.com">Concordant Solutions</a>. Read <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/07/29/why-i-am-killing-my-company-blog/">why it moved</a>.</em></small></p>

<p>This picture from Spotify is a great example of how to look at product iteration. Notice that in the image, Spotify focuses on the core features of the product and delivers on that. What is the core feature of a car? To transport people. It’s not an engine, or a chassis, or anything like that. All of these are features that deal with the form of the car, not it’s purpose. A car solves the problem of getting you where you want to go. So does a skateboard.</p>

<p>What problem is your product trying to solve, and how can you get to a workable prototype as quickly as possible?</p>

    <updated>2014-08-01T07:57:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/08/01/from-blogging-to-content-strategy</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>There is whole wide world of content publishing outside of blogging</h3>

<p><img class="left" src="http://glennstovall.com/images/articles/writing.jpg" width="260"></p>

<p><small class='notice'><em>This post originally appeared on <a href="http://www.concordantsolutions.com">Concordant Solutions</a>. Read <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/07/29/why-i-am-killing-my-company-blog/">why it moved</a>.</em></small></p>

<p>Writing is a powerful tool you can use in your business. Maybe you realize that you should be writing more and using content to help build your business, but you aren’t sure how to start.</p>

<p>People tend to default to ‘blogging’, which isn’t exactly wrong. Blogging is one of the simplest ways to get your content out there. However, blogging is only one tool that is available to you. The issue with focusing on only blogging is that when you only have a hammer, everything starts to look like a nail.</p>

<p>The idea is that you should find alternative channels for your content, and decide which is best for each piece of content you write. Now when I write, I don’t sit down with the intent to write a blog post, I sit down with the intent to create content, and then decide how that content should best be used.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>Email</h3>

<p>Despite all the new ways we have found to communicate online, email is still one of the most effective forms of marketing. Delivering valuable content straight to someone’s inbox is more powerful than sending it to them via an RSS reader or through social media. Patrick McKenzie, a developer who has over 7,000 email subscribers, doesn’t have a blog at all anymore, he sends all of his writing out via email.</p>

<p>If you have a piece of content that has a strong call to action, and you have a good list, then an email may be a better option.</p>

<h3>White papers &amp; Ebooks</h3>

<p>Sometimes content that is longer and deeper and be put into a more finalized, published form. One option is to release a white paper. A white paper is generally a 5 to 10 page PDF about a particular subject.</p>

<p>White papers can be a powerful marketing tool, especially when combined with email lists. You could offer to give users a white paper in exchange for their email address, and then send it to them automatically when they join your mailing list. eBooks can serve he same purpose. The founder of Freshbooks recently wrote and released an eBook completely free called “Breaking The Time Barrier“. Breaking The Time Barrier is an interesting example since in the book, he advocates against freelancer’s billing by the hour, which is one of the main features of his software.</p>

<p>However, what the book does accomplish is providing value to his main client base by explaining to freelancers how changing their billing structure can make them more money. By doing this he built trust among his current and potential customers, and was able to generate a lot of traffic by offering something so valuable for free.</p>

<p>eBooks can also become a profitable product. People like Nathan Barry Have built successful businesses mainly based on selling three books he has written.</p>

<h3>Audio &amp; Video</h3>

<p>Content doesn’t always have to be just written. More and more people are moving to using audio and video as a way to deliver content. Audio and video are strong tools, mainly because they are more rare than plain written content. It also gives you alternatives way to promote your message. Just writing text will not get you on YouTube. Different people like to consume content in different ways, so having multiple options lets you reach out to the maximum audience. If you have educational content, you could also use this as a path to monetization by using a service such as SkillShare.</p>

<h3>Reworking Content</h3>

<p>Content doesn’t always have to take a single form. You can take content from any of these and transfer it to a different medium. This can give you the opportunity to expand on your message, and reach a wider audience. For example, maybe you write a blog article, and you realize you have a lot more to say on the subject, so you create a 5 part email course on the subject. Maybe you take that course and record a video of it and put it on youtube.</p>

<p>By increasing the fidelity of the message, you can also increase the value. Video is a better teaching tool than audio, which is a better tool that just plain text.</p>

<p>We are all capable of creating great content to share with the world, and there are many more ways to share than by just blogging. Find the channel that let’s your voice shine through the clearest.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Launch Day is the Day you Switch from Guessing to Learning</h3>

<p><img class="left" src="http://glennstovall.com/images/articles/done_is_better.png" width="260"></p>

<p><small class='notice'><em>This post originally appeared on <a href="http://www.concordantsolutions.com">Concordant Solutions</a>. Read <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/07/29/why-i-am-killing-my-company-blog/">why it moved</a>.</em></small></p>

<p>In the startup community, a term that is thrown around a lot is “minimum viable product” or MVP for short. It means digging down to the smallest thing that you can launch with. Sometimes an MVP isn’t even a piece of software. It could be using an existing tool such as a spreadsheet or tool like <a href="http://www.trello.com">Trello</a> to try a process and see if it even works.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>An Example Scenario</h3>

<p>Let’s say you are working on a software as a service product. It has features A, B, C, and D, and you plan on charging $50 a month. You have two options: you can launch with all of the features, which let’s say in our example will take 6 months; Or you can launch with a smaller set and update later. In this example, let’s say that takes 2 months to launch, and then 4 more months of work on the other features.</p>

<p>So one scenario is that you spend 6 months developing your software, launch it, and you get 20 customers in your first month. That’s still something I would consider a success.</p>

<p>But let’s say you launch in 2 months with just feature A. If A was your big selling point, if it is the feature that solves problems, you would probably get the same number of initial sign ups. That already means <strong>$4,000</strong> more this strategy has made you.</p>

<p>The money isn’t even the biggest advantage. You are getting feedback from customers. They like it and start referring people. Or they hate and you figure out ways to improve. You start figuring out what features they really need. Maybe it turns out they wouldn’t like your other features at all. If that’s the case you just saved months of spending time building something that people do not want.</p>

<p>Hypothetically, let’s say they still seem like they want what you had designed. in six months, in both scenarios you have an identical product, but one of them has <strong>more customers</strong>, and is <strong>more profitable</strong> in addition to the fact it has been generating revenue for four months.</p>

<h3>How To Launch Earlier</h3>

<p>Most people don’t want to launch until something is “done”. They are scared of making a bad first impression, which is a myth. You will have several opportunities to make an impression on customers, and it is the <strong><a href="http://www.softwarepromotions.com/news/the-myth-of-the-first-impression/">impact of each that matters, not the timing</a></strong>.</p>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='build a half product, not a half-ass product.'>
However, this doesn’t mean skimping on quality. As DHH of 37Signals said build a half product, not a half-ass product.(<a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch05_Half_Not_Half_Assed.php">Source</a>) When trying to get things out the door earlier, cut back on the scale of the project, not the quality. Getting things shipped is good, but getting things shipped that are high quality is excellent.</p>

<p>When starting a new software project, (or any project for that matter) it’s always good to think “How Can I make this smaller?” “How can I launch this faster?” This kind of thinking will lead you to more plentiful and profitable launches.

<p>Many web developers and designers charge their clients by the hour. We have done that ourselves in the past. But as of 2014 I’ve decided to completely do away with hourly billing. What’s wrong with billing by the hour?</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>The Distracting Overhead</h3>

<p>When billing by the hour, in which I was really billing in 15 minute increments, that meant that time had to be tracked. It also meant that time had to be included on invoices. The problem with this is two fold; Firstly, all the time spent tracking time is time spent not providing value to clients. The second is that it leads to invoicing based on time, which makes the discussion about how long things take instead of how valuable they are. If we build you a web application that saves your company $10,000 a month, I doubt you care if it took an hour, ten hours, or 100 hours to build. All that matters to you is that you made a profitable investment. Hourly billing distracts from focuses on quality and results.</p>

<h3>The Sporadic Schedule</h3>

<p>Scheduling work based on hours can often lead to sporadic schedules. When I billed hourly, I may work for 2 hours in the morning for Client A, then maybe had planned on working for 4 hours for Client B after lunch, but then Client C calls and has an emergency that ends up taking 2 hours. All of this <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/944128/worker-interrupted-cost-task-switching">task switching isn’t free</a>, it’s another issue that harms productivity. Starting in 2014 the smallest unit of time that we bill for is a day.</p>

<h3>The Perverse Incentives</h3>

<p>The biggest reason I have decided to get rid of hourly billing is the perverse incentives that it gives to both clients and developers. As a developer, billing by the hour encourages me to not be efficient, or even worse, punishes me when I am. If I had estimated that a new feature would take 20 hours to implement, and I get it done in 10, does it make sense that I make less?</p>

<p>For clients, I have found that billing hourly leads to clients asking for cut corners and a lower quality of work. For clients, any time spent making a product better now seems worse since it comes with an additional expense.</p>

<h3>My Solution: Flat Rates and Larger Chunks of Time</h3>

<p>I don’t believe there is any one size fits all solution to pricing in the software industry. When it comes to your project, we’ll work with you to find a pricing structure that works for you. Here are some of the options that we offer:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Flat Rate:</strong> This is reserved for small or well defined projects, which tend to be a rare case. We agree on a deliverable, and that deliverable costs $x. I have services that are available to all clients in this manner, such as <a href="http://concordantsolutions.com/rome">Rome</a>, my speedy website creation, and <a href="http://concordantsolutions.com/flourish/">Flourish</a>, which helps web applications be sustainable and grow post-launch.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Weekly &amp; Monthly Billing:</strong> Weekly &amp; Monthly Billing is the cousin of flat rate billing. Weekly &amp; Monthly billing means that at the end of the agreed upon week or month, we will have a deliverable complete that costs $x. Weekly &amp; Monthly billing is great for projects that need some flexibility in pricing and have a more agile process.
I believe that this new approach will lead to me operating in a more efficient matter, and enable us to provide a higher quality of product to my clients.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><img class="left" src="http://glennstovall.com/images/articles/pirate.png" width="260"></p>

<p><small class='notice'><em>This post orignally appeared on <a href="http://www.concordantsolutions.com">Concordant Solutions</a>. Read <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/07/29/why-i-am-killing-my-company-blog/">why it moved</a>.</em></small></p>

<p>Pirate Metrics refers to an the acronym ‘AARRR’, which stands for five metrics used to track the performance of your business online. The five metrics are Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Referrals, and Revenue. By tracking these metrics, you can get a clearer picture of the health of your business, and figure out where you should focus your efforts. The idea was popularized by <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/dmc500hats/startup-metrics-for-pirates-long-version">Dave McClure</a>. These ideas are a framework for how to approach your online business and all of them won’t apply to everyone. Today I’d like to give you an overview of what they are, how to track them, and some ideas on how to improve your performance in each. I hope this will get the gears turning on how to apply them to your business.</p>

<div style='clear:both'></div>


<h3>Acquisition</h3>

<p>Acquisition is how many visits you are getting to your site. This is getting people to be aware of your existence, and giving you a chance to sell them on your product.</p>

<p><strong>How to Track It:</strong> Website visits are the easiest thing to track when it comes to your website. Tools like <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics">Google Analytics</a> make this simple.</p>

<p><strong>How to Improve It:</strong> How to increase your traffic could vary greatly depending on the type of site you have. Online advertising like Google Adwords, or on networks like Facebook or Reddit, are a direct way to get traffic. You can also try longer term strategies such as SEO and content marketing.</p>

<h3>Activation</h3>

<p>Activation is getting people to complete a call-to-action. This could mean making a sale, or getting users to sign up for a subscription services. It could even be just collecting an email address. In our case, we consider an activation someone using the contact form to get in touch with us and start a conversation. Sometimes it’s as simple as collecting an email address.</p>

<p><strong>How to Track It:</strong> Depends. most e-commerce services have ways of tracking sales, as do most CMSes. For collecting emails for newsletters, tools like Mailchimp have this built in as well.</p>

<p><strong>How to Improve It:</strong> Split testing is a good strategy here. On whatever pages you are trying to get people to sign up, test the copy, the style, your call to action, everything.</p>

<h3>Retention</h3>

<p>Retention refers to tracking that people who have become your customer stay your customer. If you have a subscription service, you don’t want people to cancel. If you are making sales, you want people to be repeat customers.</p>

<p><strong>How to Track It:</strong> If you working with customers monthly, you can track how many stay for a certain amount of time, such as 6 months. For sales, you could track how many customers are repeat customers and how often they return. Another approach would be to track the frequency in which people use your service, such as monitoring how often people log in.</p>

<p><strong>How to Improve It:</strong> The two biggest factors are the ease of use of your application and customer service. Retention relies on you keeping existing customers happy. Being responsive, testing your interface, and listening to feedback are all good ways to increase retention.</p>

<h3>Referrals</h3>

<p>Word of mouth is the most valuable form of marketing you have. Tracking referrals can give you insight into customer happiness.</p>

<p><strong>How To Track It:</strong> Social Media has made this easier. You can track how many people are mentioning you or your domain on Twitter. Be sure to interact back as well.</p>

<p><strong>How To Improve It:</strong> Make it easy for your clients to talk about you. Give them a clear message, and be sure to make sure to provide links to easily share your content.</p>

<h3>Revenue</h3>

<p>The one everyone cares about and the most explicit one. How much money you are pulling in.</p>

<p><strong>How to Track It:</strong> With your bank account.</p>

<p><strong>How to Improve It:</strong> This one is harder to improve on it’s own. It’s usually a result of working on the four above. You can try things like experimenting with your pricing model and service offerings.</p>

<p>All of these metrics will help one another, and usually aren’t in a vacuum. For example, Most things that increase retention will tend to increase referrals. Increasing referrals will increase acquisition. Increasing acquisition can increase activation, which can increase revenue, and so on.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Personal vs. Professional Blogging, Part II</h3>

<p><img class="left" src="http://glennstovall.com/images/articles/concordant-articles.png" width="260"></p>

<p>Back in March, I wrote and article, <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/03/05/personal-blogging-vs-professional-blogging/">Personal vs. Professional Blogging</a>. In that article I explained why I decided to publish my writing on  two blogs: <a href="http://www.glennstovall.com">glennstovall.com</a>, Where I planned on writing content aimed at fellow developers and freelancers. The other site was <a href="http://www.concordantsolutions.com/articles">Concordant Solutions</a> My &#8220;company brand&#8221; (<em>ugh</em>, I will never be comfortable with that phrase) where I aimed to write content I thought clients would enjoy. That hasn&#8217;t worked. Here is why, and how I plan to fix.</p>

<!-- more -->


<div style='clear:both;'></div>


<div style='clear:both;'></div>


<h3>No One Connects With a Company</h3>

<p>Unless you are a large company with a lot of authority, Most people aren&#8217;t going to be interested in your company blog. <a href="http://blog.kissmetrics.com/">KISSMetrics</a> is an exception to this rule. People would rather read an article by &#8220;Glenn&#8221;, than by &#8220;Concordant Solutions&#8221;. The second comes across as less authentic.</p>

<h3>It&#8217;s Easier to Manage One Thing Instead of Two</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s better to update blogs regularly. By having two blogs maintaining consistency is twice as hard. It also added mental overhead to every article that I wanted to write, since I had to decide where it would go, and what audience I would try to appeal to. Instead, now I can have one content management system, and one stream of content that is more steady. There were even a couple of situations where I tried to spin content so I could post it twice, which was a waste of time.</p>

<h3>It Helps SEO (At Least I&#8217;m Pretty Sure)</h3>

<p>I&#8217;m not an SEO Guru. Beyond &#8220;Content is king&#8221;, &#8220;Have a good title tag&#8221;, &#8220;No one uses the <code>&lt;meta name='keywords'&gt;</code> tag anymore, I know nothing. This is just from anecdotal observation. This domain has been around longer, gotten more traffic, and had more back links. <em>Anything</em> I publish here does better than anything I have published on my company domain. Viral traffic seems to work like high tide coming in: There is a wave of traffic that comes in quickly, and leaves just as fast. But once it is gone, It leaves the average daily visitors mark a little higher than it found it. Google must think this domain has <em>some</em> value. Why squander it?</p>

<h3>There is More Crossover Appeal Than I Originally Thought</h3>

<p>Most of my clients are small businesses or tech companies, which is not as different of an audience as I thought. Freelancers are by definition also small business owners (even if they don&#8217;t see themselves that way). And people at tech companies in a position to hire me often have a technical background. I said that they might not know what <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2013/06/27/angularjs-an-overview/">AngularJS</a> is, but that is not always the case. I can still write content aimed at a subset of my audience, but there is no reason to have two locations to do so.</p>

<h3>At The End of The Day, The Company Blog Was a Failure</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve maintained <a href="http://www.concordantsolutions.com">Concordant Solutions</a> for a year, and I am not afraid to admit that as a marketing tool, it has been a failure. I will say that as a <em>sales</em> tool, It has done some good work. The difference is that while that domain and the content on it has not brought me any new leads, it has been a great tool to help turn leads into clients. Potential clients are usually not going to find your portfolio by googling for it; They are going to see your portfolio because they said &#8220;can I see your portfolio?&#8221; and you mailed them a link.</p>

<p>My company site will still exist for that reason. Any content on there I still deem worthwhile is going to be ported over to this domain over the next couple weeks. The company site  will be a resource for past, present, and future clients. I still intend on it being a valuable sales tool. It just won&#8217;t have an articles section any longer.</p>

    <updated>2014-07-14T12:18:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/07/14/how-to-turn-your-services-into-products</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I wanted to talk to you about the idea of &#8220;productized consulting&#8221;. Productized can give you a way to package your services in a way that is easier to sell and can be scalable. Here&#8217;s a quick run down of how it works:</p>

<ul>
<li>Take a service you have provided to clients in the past.</li>
<li>Define a fixed scope and price for that service.</li>
<li>Sell that service like you would a physical product or monthly subscription.</li>
</ul>


<!-- more -->


<p><a href="http://wptheory.net">WPTheory</a> is a good example. Adam Clark  chooses a WordPress theme, install it, customize it, and put up content, in one day. He sells this package for $999. It could be difficult to convince clients to pay you a $1,000 day rate, but by positioning it this way,  Adam is able to do this frequently.</p>

<p>While $1,000/day would be nice, what if you could charge $1,000 <strong>an hour</strong>? That&#8217;s what Joanna Weibe did with their consulting product, <a href="http://copyhackers.com/product/formal-website-copy-review-with-joanna-wiebe/">The no fluff website review</a>. Joanna sends over a 60 minute video about your website, and charges you $997 for the privilege.</p>

<p>Something else that makes Joanna&#8217;s example is that while she is still providing a service, she has turned that service into a more tangible deliverable. Instead of just telling the client the changes or writing them a list, she gives them a meeting, a video, and several usable copy writing samples they can use. You can make a lot of services and meetings more valuable to the client by attaching some form of report or usable item as part of it.</p>

<p>I hope this gets the gears turning for you for some new ways to position your services. I thought about writing up a list of more examples of freelancing as a service, but it turns out the guys at Workshop already did it, and they <a href="http://letsworkshop.com/freelance-as-a-service/">knocked it out of the park</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m working on self publishing and eBook in the coming months, and I wanted to document my journey and share it with you. I have enjoyed and been inspired by other writings such as <a href="http://groovehq.com/blog">Alex Turnbull documenting his ongoing journey to get to $100,000 recurring revenue</a>, and Nathan Barry&#8217;s <a href="http://nathanbarry.com/category/the-web-app-challenge/">&#8220;Web App in Six Months Challenge&#8221;</a>. There is nothing like publicly sharing your techniques and struggles in order to both share useful information with other people, and to keep myself accountable.</p>

<h3>The Story So Far</h3>

<p>I think a lot of freelancers dream of finding ways to make money besides charging for their time. It could be by setting up recurring revenue, productizing their consulting services, or building a product they can sell individually. I decided to try what many before me have, and build a product. Heck, there is an <a href="http://chasingproduct.com">entire podcast</a> dedicated to the subject (which is really good, by the way).</p>

<p>Being a web developer, of course my first thought was to build some form of SaaS application. Enough reading on the internet scared me off of that idea (for now): SaaS applications on average take two years before they bring in enough income to stand on their own, and I know from experience they can take months to develop. I had started a couple of ideas, but could never find the time to finish them. Then I found an article by Amy Hoy called <a href="http://unicornfree.com/2013/why-you-should-do-a-tiny-product-first">&#8220;Why you should build a tiny product first&#8221;</a> and it really resonated with me. It got me thinking about products that I could complete in 90 days or less. I liked writing, and based on several freelance sites I had read before, I knew that there was a lot of interest in starting to freelance, but a lot of people didn&#8217;t know where to begin.</p>

<p>The tiny idea was also appealing because it would be a straight up easier way to launch a product. I have worked with enough small businesses and start-ups to know that launching a new business or product is <strong>hard</strong>. Really, REALLY hard. There is no reason to tackle new business ventures on hard mode, and I feel that if there is anything you can do to make things easier on yourself, you should do it. And it is much easier to write a book than build a piece of software, and it is a lot easier to convince someone to pay you $29 once instead of $29/month indefinitely.</p>

<h3>The Freelance Start-up Guide</h3>

<p>It was at this point, around the start of this year,  I decided to work on a book, then titled <strong>The Freelance Start-up Guide</strong>. It was going to be aimed at aspiring freelancers, and help them build a product from scratch. I started writing the book, and set up a mailing list. Initial response was a bit tepid on the mailing list, but there was some interest in the idea.</p>

<h3>The First Big Hurdle</h3>

<p>Around the start of February, I had a huge rush of client work, admittedly, more than I could handle. I knew something had to give, and I informed my tiny mailing list that I had shelved the project indefinitely. I knew at that time that I did not have any extra bandwidth, and had to cut work where ever I could.</p>

<h3>The Real Tiniest Product</h3>

<p>About a month ago, I decided to give building a mailing list a second try. I figured that I could build an audience before I built the product. Even if I didn&#8217;t finish that book, I would still have an audience, and that had value. I signed up for Nathan Barry&#8217;s <a href="http://www.convertkit.com">ConvertKit</a>, and during his ConvertKit academy, he gave me a valuable piece of advice: You can get a lot more email list subscriptions if you give users an incentive for signing up. I compiled some of my past blog articles, wrote some new content, and released <em><a href="http://glennstovall.com/books/freelance-pricing-handbook/">The Freelance Pricing Handbook</a></em>. This is a small, 32 page eBook that I gave away for free. I was able to grow my list from 15 to 100 subscribers overnight. You can read my case study on it&#8217;s release here.</p>

<p>This so far has been the best move I&#8217;ve made. I always liked blogging, but it had been directionless before. Now instead of people reading my article, and that bringing me no value, I could capture readers and have a way to continue engaging with them. This meant that every post I had written in the past and every post I would write in the future was more valuable. Now they weren&#8217;t just articles, they were sales tools.</p>

<h3>Version 2.0: Bootstrap Freelance</h3>

<p>Now it&#8217;s June, and my client work has returned to levels where I don&#8217;t feel completely underwater. I decided that I wanted to pick up the project and continue working on it. At this point, I had almost 65 pages written, and an email list with a couple of hundred people on it, and I didn&#8217;t want to throw all of this away. I renamed the product <em>Bootstrap Freelance</em> and decided to pick the project back up. I decided that instead of just telling people how to get their first client, I wanted to add more content based on lessons I had learned on how to build up their business after that. I&#8217;m nervous about announcing a launch date based on what happened last time, but I am shooting for a release date sometime in August.</p>

<h3>&#8230;And Here We Are</h3>

<p>Now I have roughly 80 pages of a first draft, which is about 2/3rds of what I want it to be. I am working on spending more time working not only on the book, but on marketing before that. For example, setting up a landing page for the product, and starting to public write about the progress of the book. I plan on updating this blog with information about the process, along with helpful information from the book. I am also going to send updates every single Friday to anyone who wants to help me accountable. If you&#8217;d like to keep up with the progress on the book, enter your email address below:</p>
