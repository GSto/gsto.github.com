    <link href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/12/28/2014-postmortem/"/>
    <updated>2014-12-28T14:53:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/12/28/2014-postmortem</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Every Year I take a look back at my business, and do the same exercise I do with every client project: a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmortem_documentation#Elements_of_a_project_post-mortem">postmortem</a>. I ask myself 3 questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What went well?</li>
<li>What went wrong?</li>
<li>What steps should I take in the future?</li>
</ul>


<p>This is a valuable writing exercise, and I’d strongly encourage you to do the same. This is my postmortem of 2014, as well as a review of how I did on my goals I set for myself at the beginning of the year.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Did I Hit My 2013 Goals?</h2>

<p>I was listening to <a href="http://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/episodes/episode-214-our-goals-for-2015">Episode 214 of Startups For The Rest Of Us</a>, where the hosts Rob Walling and Mike Taber look back at their goals they set for the year, and give themselves between 0 and 1 points based on wether or not they felt they achieved that goal. Before I get into my postmortem, I wanted to go through the exact same exercise.</p>

<h3>Goal: Generate a Stream of Product Based Income</h3>

<h4>Verdict: 0 points</h4>

<p>It seems like every year I have a vague goal of launching a product, and I tend not to do it. While I did launch a <a href="http://glennstovall.com/offerings/overnight-site/">Productized Service</a>, I didn’t create any kind of profitable project this year.</p>

<h3>Goal: Better Time Management</h3>

<h4>Verdict: 0.5 points</h4>

<p>I’ll give myself half a point here. While I made some improvements in managing my time, I still feel like there is a lot of room for improvement. Some good steps forward I have made has been more diligent about scheduling my time, and eliminating tasks that kept me busy, but weren’t productive.</p>

<h3>Goal: Keeping an Eye on Business Metrics</h3>

<h4>Verdict: 1 point</h4>

<p>This was mostly in regards to sales and marketing. I started using <a href="http://bit.ly/1itwiuw">PipeDrive</a> to both systemize and keep track of the numbers on my sales funnel. PipeDrive also allows you to add custom fields to your leads, so I have started tracking 4 data points on each lead that I come into contact with:</p>

<ul>
<li>Size of the company</li>
<li>Company vertical</li>
<li>Project type</li>
<li>Source of lead</li>
</ul>


<p>This way I don’t only see how many leads I am getting, but I can drill down on which leads are the most profitable, which convert the best, and what are the best sources of leads that convert.</p>

<h3>Goal: A More Defined Sales and Marketing Process</h3>

<h4>Verdict: 1 point</h4>

<p>See PipeDrive above. Now I have a defined sales process, email templates that I use for communicating to leads and prospects at various points in the conversation. This has allowed me to spend less time selling and more time creating value. I also feel that I have a strong framework for writing proposals.</p>

<p>Since I’ve implemented these practices, the number of leads I get have increased, and my conversion rate as more than doubled.</p>

<h3>Goal: Have a Better Pricing Structure</h3>

<h4>Verdict: 1 point</h4>

<p>In addition to raising my rates last year, I have eliminated work billed by the hour with the exception of some legacy clients. I finally implemented this towards the end of the year, and so far the results have been tremendous. I feel happier working not having to punch a time clock, client relationships are better, and I feel I am providing more valuable work.</p>

<p>I did experiment with daily and weekly billing, and that for the most part was a bust in my experience. Some people swear by weekly billing, however I found that many prospects didn’t “get” it, and it was just causing more friction in the sales process.</p>

<h3>Total Score: 3.5 / 5</h3>

<h2>What Went Well in 2014</h2>

<h3>Putting Myself on a Salary to Eliminate Feast and Famine</h3>

<p>In 2013, I would divide up the bounty of each paid invoice into a few different buckets: a percentage for the company coffers, a percentage for Uncle Sam, and a percentage in my pocket. Now, I pay myself a monthly stipend regardless of income. This makes personal budgeting and financial planning easier, reduces stress during the lean months. This also means that I have more cash on hand in my company account that I can invest back into the business.</p>

<h3>Diligent Practice of Inbox Zero &amp; GTD</h3>

<p>Email used to be one of those tasks that was a large time sink for me. Then I started practicing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9UjeTMb3Yk">inbox zero</a>.  Now I check email twice a day, and each time I am able to get though my inbox quickly. <a href="http://www.mailboxapp.com/">Mailbox</a> is a great app if you’d like to start practicing it.</p>

<p>On that same note, I started implementing the principles of <a href="http://gettingthingsdone.com/">Getting Things Done</a>, which is essentially the principles of inbox zero applied to your to do list. I now have one task management system, and everything I need to do goes into an inbox. The inbox is processed daily, and then tasks are knocked off. Since doing this I’ve had almost nothing fall through the cracks, and I feel less stressed and more on top of things. I use the Mac/iOS app <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a> to manage my to do lists.</p>

<h3>An Online Presence I’m Happy About</h3>

<p>I’ve gone through multiple redesigns of this site, and my company site, Concordant Solutions. I finally <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/07/29/why-i-am-killing-my-company-blog/">decided to only manage one site</a>, and give it a facelift. It’s an ongoing process, but right now I feel like my site is the best it has ever been.</p>

<h3>Writing and Publishing More Content</h3>

<p>I invested a lot more in writing content this year. I’ve had some articles gain some traction, including making the Medium.com top 100 one month. I also published a free eBook that has been downloaded over 1,000 times. Both of them have helped me reach more people, and have started many a great conversation. Here are my most popular posts in 2014:</p>

</ul>


<h3>Building an Audience</h3>

<p>While I had good intentions as far as releasing products went, I wanted to start building an audience of people beforehand. While the product idea never came to fruition, I’m glad that I started this. I have had some <em>fantastic</em> conversations, Got invites to be a speaker on a webinar, and get to keep in touch and build relationships with people at scale.</p>

<p>Building an audience also gives everything else I do more purpose. Now writing articles isn’t just about sharing content, it’s an entryway to building relationships.</p>

<h3>Joining a Mastermind</h3>

<p>Being self employed is lonely work. If there is one thing I miss from the employed world (in fact, I think this is the <strong>only</strong> thing), It is having people to relate to what you are doing, and  being able to reach out for help.</p>

<p>This year I joined a mastermind with three other freelancers. Each week we hop on a Google Hangout, and discuss what is going on in our business. It gives each of a chance to get a few extra pairs of eyes on anything we’re working on, and a forum to even about frustrations we wouldn’t otherwise. I’ve learned just as much, if not more from the conversations I’ve had in these mastermind meetings than I have all the books and podcasts I’ve consumed this year.</p>

<h2>What Went Wrong in 2014</h2>

<h3>A Sabbatical That Went Unintentionally Long</h3>

<p>After a couple of large projects and heavy workload, I became burned out towards the middle of the year. I had some money in the bank, and decided to schedule some time off to rest and invest some time in my business. This turned out to be the worst decision I made all year.</p>

<p>Firstly, trying to take time off and invest in my business was a poor plan. It really should have been one or the other. Secondly, It just enough small jobs rolled in that I didn’t really get to relax or make very money, leaving me dealing with the worst of both worlds. Finally, it’s hard to build up momentum after stopping. What was going to be a break of a few weeks ended up being more like a break of a few <em>months</em>, which really put pressure on both my cash flow and sanity.</p>

<p>On the bright side, this was also the moment that led me to do a lot of introspection and make some decisions about what my business was going to look like in the future.</p>

<h3>A Company Brand That Was Dead In The Water</h3>

<p>Last year I formed an LLC and formed a company site called “Concordant Solutions”. Both the site and the brand was a failure in every metric I can think to measure it in. Managing two sites was more time consuming than managing one. Any content I wrote for my company site tended to fall flat, and did not generate leads of any sort. Explaining to people in person that I was “company” that was just one person, and what the hell “Concordant” means became exhausting and distracting.</p>

<p>For now, I’m back to being plain old me. The name Concordant Solutions now only exists in the world of contracts and invoices.</p>

<h3>The 30 Day Publishing Challenge</h3>

<p>In September, I decided to join Colin Devroe in taking a <a href="http://cdevroe.com/blog/9527/blogging-every-weekday-for-30-days">challenge to publish something every weekday for 30 days.</a> While I did finish the challenge, (and wrote a <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/10/02/30-day-publishing-challenge-postmortem/">postmortem</a> about that too), I don’t think it was that valuable of an exercise. It led me to publishing a lot of content that wasn’t all that good, and took up a lot of my time.</p>

<p>I think that if you were tempted to do something similar, writing every 30 days would be a much better goal.</p>

<h3>I Didn’t Launch a Product</h3>

<p>This is something that has been on my goal list for a few years, and one I haven’t been able to capitalize on. I started work on a few, but I was usually stopped by the fear that I was launching a product for product’s sake, and not because I was unsure that It would be valuable. This is a fear I need to get over, so I can at least try to launch something to generate a more passive revenue stream.</p>

<h3>Problems With Client Communication and Expectations</h3>

<p>I had some client relationships this year that didn’t go as well as either one of us would have liked.I did a poor job of managing the client relationship and their expectations. Since these experiences I’ve worked hard at streamlining my communication and pricing structure to support a better relationship.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, the relationship between a consultant and their client should be a partnership. However, I think we all do things that tend to frame it instead as an adversarial relationship.</p>

<p>My shift away from hourly billing was based on these principles. When billing based on time, the client has a financial incentive to decrease your contribution to a product, while it gives you a financial incentive to increase it. Right off the bat, this is the kind of adversarial relationship I was unknowingly fostering.</p>

<h2>Steps Moving Forward</h2>

<h3>A More Systemized Business</h3>

<p>This is my primary goal for 2015. This year I learned about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_operating_procedure">standard operating procedures</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/E-Myth-Revisited-Michael-E-Gerber-ebook/dp/B000RO9VJK/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;sr=&amp;qid=">how to separate yourself from your business.</a> While I have written some procedures, My coverage is far from complete. The ones I have written have been valuable, and I really want to double down on this.</p>

<p>Standard operating procedures are just step one in building a more scalable, effective business. Even just by themselves, they reduce the mental overhead of making decisions, much like <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/nov/10/obama-zuckerberg-us-president-facebook-founder">wearing the same clothes everyday</a>. But beyond that, they enable you to hand work off or automate. Once you have a defined process, you can hand that work off to a virtual assistant, a subcontractor, or a python script. (Standard operating procedures are basically Python scripts for human beings).</p>

<h3>Strategic Outsourcing</h3>

<p>When I started this business two years ago, if you asked me which parts of my job would be the first to be outsourced, I would not have guessed the actual production work. After all, writing code is <em>what I do</em>. Or at least that is how I used to look at it.</p>

<p>Now, I see that I have much more interest and provide more value in dealing with the “big picture” issues of both my own company and of my clients. Neither one of those requires me to write code.</p>

<p>I don’t plan on removing myself from writing code completely, nor do I plan to be a middle man that farms out work to the lowest bidder on the other side of the world. What I <strong>do</strong> plan on doing is sending well defined parts of projects off to other implementers, and relying more on people that have stronger skills than I do, such as graphic design.</p>

<p>I fully expect this to enable to provide more value to every one of my clients than I have in the past two years.</p>

<h3>Better Positioning</h3>

<p>This year, I made some good steps moving from “guy who writes code” to “guy who solves problems”. This year, I want to hammer out exactly what kinds of problems those are. There is more than enough work available in the world, and being a generalist does more harm than good. In the coming year I hope to have a more clear positioning statement and brand. That might a new job title, it might mean a new company brand. What it definitely means is a marketing strategy that is laser focused on a particular set of problems that a particular set of people have.</p>

<h3>Investing In My Business</h3>

<p>I invested significantly more in my education and in networking than I did last year, and both paid off in spades. Many books I’ve read, groups I’ve joined, and services I’ve used have paid for themselves many times over. This year I’m excited to find more opportunities where I believe I can make my money work for me.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>And 5 Tips to Improve Each One</h3>

<p>The end of the year will be here soon. It&#8217;s a time to reflect on how the past year went, and plan for the next year. There are three numbers that are the determining factors for your bottom line. By understanding these numbers, you will know what metrics you need to move in order to get the business results you want. By doubling just one of three numbers, you&#8217;ll double you revenue, without doubling your workload. So instead of saying &#8220;I want to make more money next year&#8221;, by the end of this email I want you to say <strong>how</strong> you plan to make more money next year.</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>Metric #1: Number of Leads</h2>

<p>You want to measure this as number of leads per month or per quarter. A <strong>lead</strong> is defined as any person who has expressed interest and capability in purchasing your services. If you respond to a listing on a job board, that is not a lead. However, if the person you contacted responds to you and wants to continue the conversation, that is a lead. If you are consistently turning some of leads into customers, then more leads will always equal more customers, which equals more revenue.</p>

<h2>Metric #2: Conversion Rate</h2>

<p>Your <strong>conversion rate</strong> is the percentage of leads that you convert into customers. Don&#8217;t get discouraged if this number is low. I consider 10% to be a good conversion rate, and anything above that to be excellent. By increasing your conversion rate, you can increase the number of customers that you bring in, without increasing the amount of time you spend on sales. If you need 3 customers a month to make enough money, and your conversion rate is 5%, then you need to start conversations with 60 potential leads a month. If your conversion rate is 10%, then you only need 30.</p>

<p> <em>(If you don&#8217;t use a CRM to track your leads and conversion, I would highly recommend getting one. There are hundreds to choose from, but I like <a href="http://bit.ly/1itwiuw">PipeDrive</a>)</em></p>

<h2>Metric #3: Customer Lifetime Value</h2>

<p><strong>Customer lifetime value</strong> (often shortened to &#8216;LTV&#8217;) is the average amount that a customer pays you as long as you two do business together. If you don&#8217;t know what this number is, you can calculate it by adding up the total amount each client has payed you for all invoices, and then find the average. For example, let&#8217;s say you bill weekly at $2,000 per week. Your last quarter looks like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Client A: 3 weeks of work:   $6,000</li>
<li>Client B: 5 weeks of work:  $10,000</li>
<li>Client C: 2 week of work:    $4,000</li>
<li>Your customer LTV:       $6,667</li>
</ul>


<p>The more you make per customer, then the less customers you need to make revenue.Once you know these numbers, you can project your income for 2015. The formula looks like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>$leads_per_month * $conversion_rate * $customer_ltv * 12 = $annual_revenue. </span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>So, let&#8217;s say you made around $50,000. Your year might look like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>8 leads per month * 10% conversion rate * $5000 LTV * 12 = $48,000</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p></p>

<p>So, what if next year you want to make closer to $100,000? Instead of setting an arbitrary goal, now you can focus on moving the needle on a particular metric. If you wanted to double you revenue, you either need to figure out how to get more leads, increase your conversion rate, or increase the average amount a customer pays you.</p>

<h3>Tips for Increasing Leads</h3>

<ul>
<li>Adding an email capture to your website, start building a newsletter, and bring in clients that way.</li>
<li>Send more emails out on job boards that you frequent.</li>
<li>Give a seminar or a talk to prospective customers.</li>
<li>Double down on whatever is currently working for you. If you meet people in person, go to even more events.</li>
<li>Get more referrals, by asking for them. Reach out to past clients and current colleagues.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Tips for Increasing Your Conversion Rate</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/09/15/why-multiple-packages-in-your-proposals-instantly-increase-conversions/">Add packaging to your proposals</a>, in order to give clients more ways to say yes.</li>
<li>What have clients said before about why they decided to hire you? Work that into your emails and conversations.</li>
<li>Do clients trust you? Add some convincing work to your portfolio, or get testimonials from past clients.</li>
<li>Add calls to action to all of your client emails. Always make it clear how a client should proceed to move towards working with you.</li>
<li>Get comfortable saying this sentence to prospects: &#8220;So, what is going to take to get you to become a client of mine?&#8221;</li>
</ul>


<h3>Tips for Increasing Customer Lifetime Value</h3>

<ul>
<li>Raising your rate. Easy-peasy.</li>
<li>Find ways to provide more value for your clients. For example, if you are a developer, providing documentation for other developers or an &#8221;instruction manual&#8217; to your client can be a value add that you should price for accordingly.- Offer auxilery services. If you design sites, you could also learn to handle some of the copy writing or data entry for the client.</li>
<li>Sell retainers. Find a way you can provide value to your clients on a monthly basis, and sell clients on those services.</li>
<li>Up-sell. The best time to add someone to the beginning of your sales pipeline is right after a completed project. If you can think of another project that would be beneficial to the client, or a retainer mentioned above, that would be the perfect time to sell them on it.</li>
</ul>


<p>What are your goals for 2015? And <a href="http://glennstovall.com/contact">what could I do to help you achieve them?</a></p>

    <link href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/11/14/how-to-decide-between-squarespace-and-a-web-designer/"/>
    <updated>2014-11-14T00:05:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/11/14/how-to-decide-between-squarespace-and-a-web-designer</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="http://glennstovall.com/images/squarespace_vs_designer.jpg" width="260"></p>

<p>You have a new idea you want to explore. Or maybe you are about to open the doors on your new brick and mortar business. Either way, you need a new website. I used to advise clients against &#8220;do it yourself website builders&#8221;,
such as <a href="http://www.squarespace.com/">Squarespace</a>, <a href="http://www.weebly.com/">Weebly</a>, and <a href="http://www.wix.com/">Wix</a>. But in the past few years, the tools have evolved into a solution that is a good fit for a lot of people.So, when should you use a tool like SquareSpace, and when is a professional web designer worth the investment?</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Our Two Options</h2>

<p>There are a lot of options out there for hosting your own site, and for building your own site. To keep this article simple, I am going to compare two particular approaches: using <a href="http://www.squarespace.com/">Squarespace</a> to build your site, and hiring a designer to build a custom hosted site using <a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress</a></p>

<h2>When To Use Squarespace</h2>

<h3>When you just need something simple.</h3>

<p>If all you need is a homepage, a couple images, and a contact form, then using SquaresSpace will suit your needs just fine. Squarespace has limited functionality, but it isn&#8217;t much of a limitation if you don&#8217;t need to go beyond it.</p>

<h3>When the site you are building is temporary.</h3>

<p> If you are making a site for an event, or for a limited time offering, then I wouldn&#8217;t invest too much time or money into it. In those cases, a quick page on SquareSpace, or possibly a landing page service such as <a href="http://leadpages.net">LeadPages</a> would suit your needs better.</p>

<h3>When you need your site up TODAY.</h3>

<p> If you hire a designer to build your site for you, there is the process of getting a contract signed, figuring out money, defining the design and scope, etc. With Squarespace, you can have a site up and running in just a couple of hours.</p>

<h3>When the ROI doesn&#8217;t make sense.</h3>

<p> How much money is your website going to make you this year? This is an important consideration when building your site. Web designers can be expensive. If you don&#8217;t think your website will bring in at least $5,000 in revenue to your business, I would go for squarespace.</p>

<h1>When to Hire a Designer</h1>

<h3>When you need the consulting and expertise.</h3>

<p> The most important part of hiring a professional is not the final product they deliver, it&#8217;s the expertise that goes into it. Any web developer or designer should have the experience to help guide you along the way, and make sure you know how to best wield the tool they are building for you.</p>

<h3>You need complex functionality (or you might one day).</h3>

<p> While Squarespace is good for simple sites, if you have more complex needs, then you may want to consider hosting your own solution. The power of WordPress is that it is almost infinitely customizable and extendable. Even if you don&#8217;t need much right out of the gate, if you plan on adding functionality down the line, you should consider starting with a hosted solution, in order to prevent the additional cost of migrating from one platform to another.</p>

<h3>You need user rights management.</h3>

<p> Who is going to be writing the content for your website? If it is just you, then Squarespace will work fine. However, if you have employees or interns that will be working on the site, and you want them to be able to contribute without giving them the keys to everything, you will need a more robust solution such as WordPress. WordPress allows you to give users different levels of rights, so you can invite people to contribute without giving them ability to change things such as design.</p>

<h3>When you find a worthwhile investment.</h3>

<p> Hiring a designer, and building custom functionality are more costly, but is it an investment that will pay off for your business? If you find a designer or have functionality that you believe will generate more revenue for your business, then it is one of the best investments you can make in your company. Your website is like a marketer that never sleeps. If you build the right one it can be an investment that keeps on giving.</p>

<p> That&#8217;s why I offer my <a href="http://glennstovall.com/offerings/overnight-site">overnight site</a>  service. I&#8217;ve streamlined the process as much as I could, so that can deliver results to clients at a price that makes it an investment, and not an expense. I&#8217;m always game to hear about your idea, and I have no problem telling you to not hire me and use Squarespace if it makes more sense for your business. But if does make sense to bring in some professional guidance, or you would rather spend time doing more valuable things for your business and let me worry about it, then I hope we can <a href="http://glennstovall.com/offerings/overnight-site">work together</a>.</p>

    <id>http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/10/15/5-ways-to-build-a-200000-consultancy</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="http://glennstovall.com/images/articles/5waysto_key.png" width="260"></p>

<p>I recently read an article entitled <a href="http://christophjanz.blogspot.com/2014/10/five-ways-to-build-100-million-business.html">5 ways to build a $100 million dollar business</a>. It discusses different business models that vary on the number and size of your customer base. Some businesses work with a few enterprise scale clients, while others work with a larger number of smaller customers. Patrick Mackenzie mentioned on Twitter that <a href="https://twitter.com/patio11/status/521878305151000577">&#8220;The math here is equally applicable if you are trying to build, say, a $200k a year business&#8221;</a>.A $200k/yr consultancy is a goal that seems both attractive and attainable, so I decided try and answer the question &#8220;How can you build a $200,000 consultancy?&#8221;</p>

<!-- more -->


<div style='clear:both;'></div>


<h3>Find 1 Client That Pays You $200,000 (The Elephant)</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve been a part of projects where a single engagement has had a price tag of $200,000 or more. I think this scenario is a little unlikely. If you can find one of these clients, then you can find more, and you are on your way to becoming a $1mm+ consultancy. It would also be very risky for a company to put all of it&#8217;s eggs in one basket like this.</p>

<h3>Find 10 Clients That Pay You $20,000 (The Deer)</h3>

<p>There are a few examples of consultancies that make this kind of money. One is custom application development services that can handle ten projects in a year. Most of the client work I find is in this range. Another example is high end consulting engagements. People like <a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/">Patrick Mackenzie</a> and <a href="http://doubleyourfreelancing.com/">Brennan Dunn</a> charge anywhere from $10,000 - $30,000 for a week of their services. They could work 10 engagements a year and hit this $200,000 benchmark.</p>

<h3>Find 100 Clients That Pay You $2,000 (The Rabbits)</h3>

<p>With this setup, your consultancy would have to have a service that scales very well. One way to accomplish this would be to find a way to service multiple clients at one time. Hosting courses or seminars is a way you could accomplish this. For example, Big Nerd Ranch offers <a href="https://training.bignerdranch.com/classes/advanced-ios-bootcamp">programming courses that cost $4,200</a>. At this point, the focus of the work changes. This is less of a consulting model and more of an information product model. There are plenty of gigs out there that pay $2,000 for smaller jobs, which are fine but those are hard to scale.</p>

<h3>Find 1,000 Customers That Pay You $200 (The Mice)</h3>

<p>At this level, you need a product that you can resell. It could be a course that requires little to no interaction for $200 (For example, a <a href="https://www.udemy.com/comprehensive-ruby-on-rails/?dtcode=Q73iZAp1GbIa">UDemy</a> course), or it could be some form of subscription product, which would cost just shy of $20/month. For software developers, you may be able to build a premium software framework or plugin that can sell for this amount. The <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/">Magento Connect marketplace</a> is a good example of people going this model. I can&#8217;t think of any kind of repeatable service model that works at this scale.</p>

<h3>Find 10,000 Customers That Pay You $20 (The Files)</h3>

<p>You are a product business at this point. You could sell ebooks, themes, plugins, or something of that nature. You really can&#8217;t call it a consultancy at this point. For this kind of business, it looks like the math doesn&#8217;t scale don&#8217;t quite so well at this point.</p>

<h3>Applying This To Your Business</h3>

<p>Do you want to work on $2,000 or $200,000 projects? Before you say &#8220;$200,000, duh.&#8221; Think about the pros and cons of fewer clients vs. more, and smaller clients vs. large. Fewer larger clients means a more rigorous, in-depth sales process, and a higher risk if you lose a client.</p>

<p>What kind of consultancy do you want to run, and how are you going to scale it? You can scale not only by getting more clients, but by getting bigger ones as well. If you think about the kind of business you <strong>want</strong> to be running, then you can start making deliberate steps to get there.</p>

    <link href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/10/02/30-day-publishing-challenge-postmortem/"/>
    <updated>2014-10-02T14:18:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/10/02/30-day-publishing-challenge-postmortem</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today is final day #30 of the <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/09/03/30-day-blogging-challenge/">30 Day publishing challenge</a>. Whenever I finish a project, I write a postmortem. I ask myself three questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What went well?</li>
<li>What went wrong?</li>
<li>What can I do better next time?</li>
</ul>


<p>This is a breakdown of the lessons learned from publishing a whole lot of content for a month.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>What Went Well</h2>

<h4>I Have Almost Double The Content on My Site</h4>

<p>More content tends to mean more search engine traffic, and more content to share. According to Google Analytics, my search engine traffic is up 4%, and social media shares are up 300%.</p>

<h4>I Learned How to Build A Strong Habit</h4>

<p>I have tried many weekly or monthly challenges in the past, and I tend to not do well at them. I&#8217;m not sure why this time was different, but I was able to stick it out for the entire 30 days. It gave me more confidence it taking on these kinds of challenges.</p>

<h4>I Make Fewer Spelling Errors</h4>

<p>And overall, I feel like my ability to put words on the page has improved. In addition to all of the articles and pages, I also put out a <a href="http://glennstovall.com/products/building-audiences/">60-page case study on building your audience</a>. It didn&#8217;t go over as well as I would have liked, but putting 10,000 words about a single topic felt really good.</p>

<p>The key to getting better at anything is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_(learning_method">deliberate practice</a>#Deliberate_practice), and this challenge gave me an opportunity to practice my writing skills.</p>

<h4>I Had to Get More Creative</h4>

<p>I usually keep a list of article ideas that I can reach too whenever I need to write something. That list is barren after this challenge. However, it did force me to find some new ways to create content, and force me to put ideas on paper that were always sitting around waiting for &#8216;one day&#8217;.</p>

<h2>What Went Wrong</h2>

<h4>I Published Some Sub-par Content</h4>

<p>Being constrained to publishing something everyday means that some content went out the door before I felt it was ready. I&#8217;m not as proud of some of the content as I should have been. This also meant they I published several shorter articles, when I usually tend to like writing longer form content.</p>

<h4>My Writing Wasn&#8217;t Focused</h4>

<p>I believe you should publish content with some kind of goal in mind. By being forced to write everyday, I wrote about a variety of topics: <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/09/22/yeoman-plus-angularjs-plus-foundation-a-modern-front-end-setup/">front end development</a>, <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/09/15/why-multiple-packages-in-your-proposals-instantly-increase-conversions/">freelancing</a>, <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/09/09/how-to-write-more-personal-emails-to-your-list-that-get-open-and-convert/">email marketing</a>, <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/09/11/lessons-learned-from-thomas-edisons-factory-fire/">stoicism</a> and even <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/09/05/niche-blogging/">writing itself</a>. It leads to an unfocused site of content.</p>

<p>On the other hand, <a href="http://jamesclear.com/">James Clear</a> writes about bodybuilding, entrepreneurship, and photography, so maybe that isn&#8217;t so bad.</p>

<h4>I Was Distracted</h4>

<p>I spent a bit more time on this than I should have. While I believe my content strategy is part of my larger business plan, I did invest too much during the month in writing. Once I got to day 17, the challenge became like a drug. I <em>had</em> to finish it at that point, sometimes at the detriment of more important work.</p>

<h2>What To Do Better Next Time</h2>

<h4>Write Instead of Publish Everyday</h4>

<p>I believe that writing is a valuable asset. It has helped me grow my business. The habit I built was also beneficial. Instead of being required to put something out there, In the future I want to focus on putting out fewer, more useful pieces.</p>

<h4>More Focus</h4>

<p>When you write frequently, you learn a lot about how to write. When you publish frequently, you learn a lot about how people react to what it is that you write. During this month I have learned what people like, and what people don&#8217;t. This is going to affect what I publish about in the future. This month was playing around; now it&#8217;s time to put some real effort in writing content that I hope you&#8217;ll find valuable.</p>

    <link href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/09/29/good-copywriters-borrow/"/>
    <updated>2014-09-29T15:11:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/09/29/good-copywriters-borrow</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="http://glennstovall.com/images/articles/thief.jpg" width="260"></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time writing this year, and especially this month with the <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/09/03/30-day-blogging-challenge/">30 day publishing challenge</a>. Something I have discovered is that writing is not as hard as it looks. You may think that you have to write for inspiration to strike, and if doesn&#8217;t, you can complain about &#8220;writer&#8217;s block&#8221;.</p>

<p>Writer&#8217;s block just means you aren&#8217;t looking heard enough. There is inspiration for copy everywhere. Pablo Picasso always said &#8220;Good artists borrow, great artists steal&#8221;. When you don&#8217;t know what to say about your company or your product, then it&#8217;s time to go on a caper and find some messages you can use in your copy.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>Steal From Your Customers</h3>

<p>Keep notes on interactions you have with past, present, and future customers. Your copy writing needs to be in your customer&#8217;s language, not your own. If you have collected testimonials, that can be a great place to start. Sales meetings, request for proposals, and job board postings are all also good places.</p>

<p>This will also help you create higher converting copy. People like when they read something and think &#8220;wow, they really get me!&#8221; By speaking your customers language, and addressing points you got straight from the horse&#8217;s mouth, you will be more in tune with your customer&#8217;s needs.</p>

<h3>Steal From Your Competitors</h3>

<p>Look at the sites of a few of your competitors, there are three things you want to pay attention to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Their headings and subheadings.</li>
<li>Their calls-to-action.</li>
<li>Anything else that makes you stop and go &#8220;Hmm!&#8221;.</li>
</ul>


<p>You don&#8217;t want to take these lines verbatim, but instead get an overall feel for how other people are approaching the market. You can make a spreadsheet of these three things to keep track.</p>

<p>This will also help you make sure that you are saying something unique. You don&#8217;t have to be the best in your market, just different. You could even make your headline the opposite of your competitors. If they focus on being the biggest, you can focus on being a smaller, more personal brand, for example.</p>

<h3>Steal From Other People&#8217;s Feedback</h3>

<p>Amazon reviews are another great source for ideas. Search for books related to your services, and see what people are talking about. Look at 5-star reviews to get an idea of what people like, and 1-star reviews to see what problems people have and what you should avoid.</p>

<h3>Further Reading</h3>

<p>The idea of this approach is to turn writing from a creative practice into a scientific one; From a passive way of writing to an <strong>active</strong> way. Joanna Weibe of CopyHackers has a great article on this idea: <a href="http://copyhackers.com/2012/09/headline-formulas-and-the-science-of-high-converting-copywriting/">Headline Formulas and the Science of CRO Copy writing</a></p>

    <link href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/09/26/testing-angularjs-with-karma-plus-jasmine/"/>
    <updated>2014-09-26T15:34:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/09/26/testing-angularjs-with-karma-plus-jasmine</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="http://glennstovall.com/images/angular.png" width="260"></p>

<p>In a previous article about <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/09/22/yeoman-plus-angularjs-plus-foundation-a-modern-front-end-setup/">Yeoman, AngularJS, and Foundation</a>, I talked about setting up a complete front end application scaffold with Yeoman, AngularJS, and Foundation. Now I want to look at how to test the AngularJS part of your application.</p>

<!-- more -->


<div style='clear:both;'></div>


<h2>The Tools</h2>

<h3>Karma</h3>

<p><a href="http://karma-runner.github.io/0.12/index.html">Karma</a> is a test runner for NodeJS. You can use it to simulate multiple devices. What Karma isn&#8217;t is a testing framework itself. It is designed to work with multiple testing frameworks, such as <a href="http://jasmine.github.io/">Jasmine</a>, <a href="http://qunitjs.com/">QUnit</a>, or <a href="http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/">Mocha</a>.</p>

<h3>Jasmine</h3>

<p>I&#8217;m using Jasmine for a couple of reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>I looked into Jasmine and QUnit before, and I have never seen two tools as similar. Their syntax is different, but how they function is <em>identical</em> last time I checked. Months ago I flipped a coin, it was &#8216;tails&#8217;, and I implemented Jasmine on a client project. No real reason to change.</li>
<li>I haven&#8217;t looked into Mocha. It might be better, or worse, or also identical. I don&#8217;t know. If <strong>you</strong> have an opinion, <a href="http://www.glennstovall.com/contact">let me know</a>.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s installed by default by Yeoman &#8230; sort of.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Step 1: Fix The Missing Dependencies</h2>

<p>For some reason, the <code>generator-angular</code> generator comes with some, but not all of the tools we&#8217;ll need for running tests with Karma and Jasmine, so we need to fix that before we get started. Run the following lines on the command line:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>npm install grunt-karma --save-dev
</span><span class='line'>npm install karma-phantomjs-launcher --save-dev
</span><span class='line'>npm install karma-jasmine --save-dev</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Step 2: Test the Tests</h2>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>grunt test</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This should ensure that everything is installed correctly. If you running a clean install from Yeoman, then it should run that test. You can look at the file /test/spec/controllers/MainCtrl.js for an example of what a test looks like.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Create A Simple Test</h2>

<p>Here is an example test, just to get you comfortable with the Jasmine testing Syntax. Create a file at <code>test/spec/app.js</code>, and write the following code:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="s1">&#39;use strict&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">describe</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;javascript&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">it</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;should know 2 + 2 is 4&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="nx">expect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">toEqual</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">});</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I enjoy jasmine&#8217;s matchers and syntax because it reads like english.</p>

<p><code>describe()</code> is how you group your tests into suites. You can nest <code>describe()</code> calls as many levels deep as youwish, though any more than two and it gets really difficult to read and manage. <code>it()</code> is how you run tests. The first argument is the description, the second is the test itself. <code>expect()</code> is where you test your assumptions in the test, and <code>toEqual()</code> is your matcher. you can also add <code>not()</code> before any more matcher to test the opposite:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="c1">//it&#39;s 2014, not 1984 ... I think</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">it</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;should know 2 + 2 is not 5&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">expect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">not</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="nx">toEqual</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you want to know what other matchers are available to you with Jasmine, here is a handy <a href="http://www.cheatography.com/citguy/cheat-sheets/jasmine-js-testing/">Jasmine Cheat Sheet</a></p>

<h2>Step 4: Now For a Real Test</h2>

<p>By default, Yeoman comes with a controller test, you can see how it works there:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>

</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'>

<p>Here you see some of the other handy features, such as <code>beforeEach()</code>. <code>beforeEach()</code> takes a function as an argument, and calls it before each test.</p>

<h2>Dependency Injection and Testing</h2>

<p>When you start writing tests you will begin to see why <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection">Dependency Injection</a> is so valuable. When you create services in Angular, you want to pass them as arguments instead of creating them directly. This way, you can create mock versions of anything for testing.</p>

<p>Here is an example test from a client project:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>I created functions that would return mock objects such as <code>mock_project()</code> and <code>mock_task()</code>. This way, I can test the <code>Project</code> object without the <code>Task</code> object. This way, all of my tests are completely self-contained, the waygood unit tests should be.</p>

    <link href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/09/22/yeoman-plus-angularjs-plus-foundation-a-modern-front-end-setup/"/>
    <updated>2014-09-22T14:18:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/09/22/yeoman-plus-angularjs-plus-foundation-a-modern-front-end-setup</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="http://glennstovall.com/images/angular.png" width="260"></p>

<p>With the combination of modern browsers and mobile devices having support for HTML5, CSS3, and new JavaScript APIs, front end development has become a lot more complex and exciting. There has been an explosion of tools as of late, and it can be daunting to know where to get started. Here are the tools and process I use in order to build a new front end application from scratch.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>The Tools</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Yeoman</strong> : For scaffolding our web application.</li>
<li><strong>Bower</strong> : For front-end dependency management.</li>
<li><strong>Grunt</strong> : Command line tool for development.</li>
<li><strong>AngularJS</strong> : JavaScript framework based on the principals of dependency injection.</li>
<li><strong>Foundation</strong>: Responsive SCSS Framework to speed up design.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Step 1: Install Yeoman and a Generator</h3>

<p>We&#8217;ll be using <a href="http://yeoman.io/">Yeoman</a> to handle all of our scaffolding. Yeoman will create the initial files and folder structure for you, so that you don&#8217;t have too. Yeoman uses generators, which are different templates it will use when creating your initial app. Yeoman is managed via npm. If you don&#8217;t have node and npm installed, you can get the <a href="http://nodejs.org/download/">NodeJS installer here</a>. I prefer building web applications with <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2013/06/27/angularjs-an-overview/">AngularJS</a>, so we&#8217;ll be installing a generator for an Angular application.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>npm install -g yo
</span><span class='line'>npm install -g generator-angular</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Step 2: Create The Scaffolding</h3>

<p>Now that we have our tools installed, it&#8217;s time to create our initial application. We&#8217;ll create a new directory and run the generator:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>mkdir example-app
</span><span class='line'>cd example-app
</span><span class='line'>yo angular</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you have everything installed correctly, Yeomen should start building your application. Select &#8216;yes&#8217; when it asks you if you want to install compass, then select no when it asks if you if you want to install Bootstrap. After a couple of minutes, you folder structure should look like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Gruntfile.js
</span><span class='line'>/app
</span><span class='line'>bower.json
</span><span class='line'>bower_components
</span><span class='line'>node_modules
</span><span class='line'>package.json
</span><span class='line'>/test</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Step 3: Install Dependencies</h3>

<p>Now we need to run our package managers to install dependencies. First, we will run NPM in order to install development dependencies, then <a href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a> to install front end dependencies:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>npm install
</span><span class='line'>bower install</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Step 4: Test The Servers</h3>

<p>Run the server and make sure everything is working OK:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>grunt serve</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Once this runs, navigate to <code>localhost:9000</code>. You should see the yeoman placeholder page.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Clean out the Crud.</h3>

<p>Yeoman adds a lot of content that is not needed. For example, it has multiple routes, controllers, and views already created for you. You can leave this in or comment it out if you want to keep an example, but I like to clear all of this out before I start working. Here is a quick checklist, so you don&#8217;t miss anything.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>app/index.html</code> - Remove most of the code in the body, but be sure to leave the div with the <code>ng-view</code> property.</li>
<li><code>app/views/main.html</code> - Remove the excess HTML.</li>
<li><code>app/scripts/app.js</code> - Remove the routes that you aren&#8217;t using. I get rid of the extra &#8216;about&#8217; route, and delete all the related files.</li>
<li>remove <code>app/controllers/about.js</code></li>
<li>remove <code>app/views/about.html</code></li>
<li>remove <code>spec/controllers/about.js</code></li>
<li><code>app/styles/main.scss</code> - Remove all of the unused styles.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Step 6: Install Foundation</h3>

<p>I prefer <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Zurb&#8217;s Foundation</a> to <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/">Twitter&#8217;s Bootstrap</a>. In my opinion, it&#8217;s easier to use and has cleaner markup. Since we are using Bower, this process is simple. Run the following command from the root directory of your project:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>bower install foundation --save</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The <code>save</code> flag will update your <code>bower.json</code> file. If you want to use any of the JavaScript functionality of Foundation, add the following to your app.js file after <code>use strict</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">foundation</span><span class="p">();</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And Done!</p>

<p>Now you have a front end application ready for development, with a whole suite of tools and frameworks installed.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://glennstovall.com/images/articles/kai-davis.jpg" width="260"></p>

<p>My friend <a href="http://kaidavis.com/">Kai Davis</a> was recently on the side hustle nation podcast. The episode is <a href="http://www.sidehustlenation.com/start-side-hustle-consulting-business-gets-paid/">How to Start a Side Hustle Consulting Business that Gets Paid</a>. One particular nugget of gold from this podcast: When asked what he would do if he had to start all over, Kai responds with how he would start a new consultancy in 16 hours.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>Hours 1-3: Identify A Target Audience</h3>

<p>Decide which market you want to focus on. This could be segmented geographically, or by industry type. If you aren&#8217;t sure where to begin, try looking at local business directories. Your local chamber of commerce is a good place to start. You could even look in a phone book if you manage to find one.</p>

<h3>Hours 4 - 8: Book Four Calls (But Not Sales Calls)</h3>

<p>Start reaching out to people who you think might be potential clients. Ask them to sit down with you over lunch or coffee, or just hop on the phone with you to discuss their business. People love talking about themselves, and even strangers will be more receptive to this than you would believe. Your goal here isn&#8217;t to sell them anything, this meeting is research. You want to find the <em>pain points</em> that your potential clients have.</p>

<h3>Hours 9 - 12: Begin Crafting A Service</h3>

<p>Now that you know what problems people in your target audience are having, how can you solve them? Look for ways you can apply your current skills and knowledge to these problems, or how to apply new skills that you could pick up in a reasonable amount of time. If you don&#8217;t find a good fit, that&#8217;s OK, you may just have to try again. You don&#8217;t marry the first person you date, and you don&#8217;t want to pursue the first job idea that comes to mind.</p>

<h3>Hours 13 - 16: Offer Your Solution</h3>

<p>Now you have connections to your market, and understanding of their problems, and a solution to those problems. Go back to your original contacts and offer your solution. Now you&#8217;re in business!</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://glennstovall.com/images/articles/audience_building_cover.png" width="260"></p>

<p>Four months ago, I decided to start building an mailing list. I wanted to build new relationships in my field and expand my network. Overtime I built the list to over 500 subscribers. After some conversations, I saw that other people were interested in how I did it. I sat down to write down a case study. I wanted to be as exact and transparent as possible. It got a little out of hand, but at the end I believe I&#8217;ve crafted a valuable guide for anyone who wants to start growing their audience.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>The Final Result</h3>

<p>This case study ended up being much longer than I anticipated. I wanted to be as specific as possible, so that other people could repeat what worked, as well as learn from my mistakes. In addition, I wanted to be transparent. I believe that the best way to teach is to teach <strong>everything</strong>. After I had collected all of my experiences, I went on to research what other people had done to grow their audience.</p>

<p>The result was over 60 pages of content, in what I originally thought might just be a blog article. I&#8217;ve put everything I&#8217;ve learned in a PDF, and you can grab it at the end of this article.</p>

<h3>Talking About Audience Building Live: September 30th</h3>

<p>After putting together this report, I thought it would be fun to talk to others about this in person. So, in addition to publishing this report, I am hosting a <a href="https://app.convertkit.com/concordant/09-30-building-audiences">live seminar in Athens, GA on Tuesday, September 30th</a>.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://glennstovall.com/images/articles/baseball.png" width="260"></p>

<p>When a freelancer submits a proposal, they will often only include one offer. They will set the deliverable, and the price, and throw their proposal over the wall. When you do this, you give the client a binary option: Hire you or don&#8217;t.</p>

<p>By giving the client a few different options, you are changing the conversation into one that is more likely to end with the client hiring you.</p>

<h3>Selling Services is More like Selling Products Than You Might Think</h3>

<p>Many of the selling principles that I mention in this article are going to be identical to the once I addressed in <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/08/04/breakdown-of-a-pricing-grid/">Breakdown of a Pricing Grid</a>. There is more common ground in selling products and selling service than most people realize. When you submit a proposal, you are selling a product to a very specific customer, and you are only selling it once.</p>

<h3>Offers And Solutions</h3>

<p>All proposals that you write follow a simple narrative. &#8220;How are you going to get the client from point A to point B?&#8221;. Point A is why they starting talking to you in the first place. This is a pain point they are having, or a moment they decided that they needed to change something in their business. A <strong>solution</strong> is &#8220;point B&#8221;. The solution is tomorrow. The solution is the inverse of the problem. The <strong>offer</strong> is how you are proposing to get the client from point A to point B. There are multiple ways you can get a client from point A to point B, and these are going to be the basis of the packages you offer.</p>

<h3>The 3 Packages You Should Include In Your Proposal</h3>

<p>Let&#8217;s say you are at bat in a baseball game. The problem is that you are not on base. The solution is that you want to get on base. There are several ways you can get there. The following is the 3 package template I use in my proposals: The bunt, The line drive, and the home run (now the image at the top of this post makes sense!). Approaching the proposal this way gets me thinking about multiple ways I can solve a client&#8217;s problem, and helps me and my clients find the offer that fits their needs and wants the best.</p>

<h3>The Bunt</h3>

<p>The lowest package you should offer should be the absolute minimum you can do to get the client to where they want to be. I also call this the <strong>half-complete package</strong>. Based on previous communications with the client, this offer is usually <strong>less</strong> than what they originally asked for. This package is useful because customers that may not have taken your core offering may take you up on this one, turning non-clients into small clients.</p>

<h3>The Line Drive</h3>

<p>This package will be the most in line with what the client requested. In the middle package, I include everything that the client has asked for or that I no are 100% crucial to a successful project. I call this one the <strong>complete package</strong>.</p>

<h3>The Home Run</h3>

<p>Once I have a handle on what the client is looking for, I ask myself &#8220;How can I go above and beyond what they asked for?&#8221;. There is where I come up with the final, most expensive package. I call this one the <strong>complete plus package</strong>. This package is a place where I can up-sell the client, and show my expertise.</p>

<h3>Multiple Packages Give You Built In Up-sells</h3>

<p>The complete plus package is a straight-up up-sell. You took the clients needs and offered to meet their expectations and then some. No matter which package your client buys, you will still have a chance to up-sell them. If they purchase the smallest package, you can always go back and offer to complete more work for them. You have already presenting the client with several offerings, and these can be valuable tools later on in the client relationship.</p>

<h3>Change The Conversation</h3>

<p>The biggest advantage to this approach is that instead of the client thinking &#8220;Do I accept this proposal or not?&#8221;, They now have options. They think &#8220;Which option on this proposal do I choose?&#8221;.</p>

<p>Despite all of the advances in technology over the past 30 years, in my opinion the best text editor for coding was created during the 1970s. <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> is a text editor that was developed at the MIT lab, created to aid engineers that were doing research on artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>Emacs is a powerful tool, one that I use everyday, but it is difficult to master. There are dozens of shortcuts and commands that you need to know in order to use if effectively. How did I learn them all? One at a time.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>I Learned Something New Because I Had No Choice</h3>

<p>I haven&#8217;t always used emacs. I started writing in more graphical text editors, such as <a href="http://www.crimsoneditor.com/">Crimson Editor</a> and <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>. Occasionally I would use larger IDE systems, such as <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/">PHPStorm</a>.</p>

<p>Then, I accepted a position at a software company in Washington DC. At this job coding was done on development servers, which means I had to log into the server via a terminal and work from there. I had zero experience with terminal based editors (kind of weird to think I made it <em>years</em> into my job before having to learn these skills). I was told that I two options: learn emacs or learn <a href="http://www.vim.org/">vim</a>. None of the tools I had used before were applicable here.</p>

<h3>The Age Old Question</h3>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war">Emacs vs Vim</a> is an age old question that developers love to debate about. I don&#8217;t want to open that can of worms here. At this job you were assigned a mentor for your first few weeks to help show you the ropes. My mentor used emacs, and would be available to help teach me there.</p>

<p>The primary difference in the two editors is how commands are structured. Both are 100% keyboard based. In Vim, you edit by having different &#8216;modes&#8217; that the editor can be set to. With emacs, you instead have a long list of shortcuts. Shortcuts either start with Ctrl, Esc, or Pressing Esc THEN another button. That actually isn&#8217;t enough to cover all of the commands needed, so then there are subsets of commands that are reached by pressing Esc+X or Ctrl+C, and then <em>another</em> command.</p>

<h3>How Could You Learn All This?</h3>

<p>Once I had completed the training at my new job, I was assigned to a job we all called &#8220;the pit&#8221;. The company had a large application with a huge customer base. It was the standard &#8220;legacy&#8221; application, meaning that it was old, complicated, and full of bugs. There were hundreds of support tickets and bug reports that had piled up, with new ones coming in every day. Keeping the bug queue in check was a Sisyphean task.</p>

<p>It was the job of the developers in the pit to work through that bug queue.</p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t the most exciting job at the time, and often times I got bored. If I only I had heard the story of <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/09/11/lessons-learned-from-thomas-edisons-factory-fire/">Thomas Edison&#8217;s fire</a> back then, I may have considered this an opportunity to learn a lesson about discipline.</p>

<p>Instead, I made it an opportunity to learn about emacs.</p>

<p>I found a <a href="http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~helio/disciplinas/MC102/Emacs_Reference_Card.pdf">cheat sheet of emacs commands</a>. Every day I would pick one single command, and make it a point to use it as much as it was applicable. I would pick a new one the next day, but I would still be using the command from the previous day.</p>

<p>I did this for a month, and I had a much better working knowledge of emacs, and could write code and fix those bugs at a quicker rate.</p>

<h3>Incremental Gains Make Huge Differences</h3>

<p>The 30-day publishing challenge has given me yet another chance to apply this daily style of learning. Every day I am choosing another stylistic point from <em>The Elements of Style</em> and applying to my writing. These small, incremental gains add up to huge gains in productivity.</p>

<p>James Clear wrote an article about a <a href="http://jamesclear.com/marginal-gains">coach who worked in marginal gains</a>. Marginal gains has a compounding effect. If you are making small gains over time, they will pile on top of each other until to have made a mountain of progress. Conversely, if you slip over time you will end up digging a pit of failure.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Edison Understood Resiliance AND Electricity</h3>

<p><img class="left" src="http://glennstovall.com/images/articles/edison_fire.jpg" width="260"></p>

<p>On December 10th, 1914, Thomas Edison was having dinner with his family. A man rushes to his door and tells Edison that his factory had caught fire. Edison grabs his son Charles and they rush our the door. They head to the factory to see what is going on. When they get there the see a  vivid display of red, green, and blue fires, due to the various chemicals stored in his laboratory.</p>

<p>This could be the end of Thomas Edison. He didn&#8217;t even have insurance on the building, because it was designed to be fireproof. Edison looks at his son and says:</p>

<blockquote><p>Go get your mother and all her friends. They&#8217;ll never see a fire like this again.</p></blockquote>




<!-- more -->


<p>Charles protested, to which Edison responded:</p>

<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s all right. We&#8217;ve just got rid of a lot of old rubbish.</p></blockquote>


<p>How was Edison able to look at a career threatening tragedy and take such a light hearted approach to such a catastrophe? Edison understood the philosophy of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism">Stoicism</a>. Stoicism tells us that negative and destructive emotions are the result of errors in judgement.</p>

<h3>The Obstacle is The Way</h3>

<p>The principal teaching of Stoicism is that we should view challenges and stress as opportunities. Instead of seeing the factory as a catastrophic blow to his business, Edison saw an opportunity to start anew. If you are an entrepreneur, you <strong>need</strong> to get comfortable with failure.</p>

<h3>Facing Failure Head On</h3>

<p>Sometimes there will be failures that are your fault, other times they are not. There may be circumstances that you couldn&#8217;t foresee or plan for. The world is chaotic, and it doesn&#8217;t owe you anything; it was here first.</p>

<p>You can&#8217;t let the control of how you react to these scenarios slip from your grasp. Every time you see crisis, you have to try and see opportunity.</p>

<h3>A Personal Story</h3>

<p>Many freelancer&#8217;s are familiar with the term &#8220;feast or famine&#8221;. It alludes to the fact that with client work, when it rains, it pours. Sometimes lots of sales come through at once, other times they don&#8217;t. It can be stressful when work is slow. I had been feeling depressed and unmotivated for days facing a recent sales slump. However, by applying the philosophy of stoicism, I can see this in a very different light:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://glennstovall.com/images/articles/time_enough.jpg"></p>

<h4>Time Enough At Last</h4>

<p>People often complain about not having enough time to accomplish everything they want. I know I have. That&#8217;s no longer an excuse. I have a lot of hours to fill up every day with whatever I so choose.</p>

<h4>Going Completely Remote</h4>

<p>A big goal I have for my consulting business is to build a system that is completely remote. While networking locally tends to be the most effective way to build connections, and will always be a part of my business strategy, it can be limiting. The internet opens up the whole wide world, and I would like to build connections with people that live more than 20 miles away from me.</p>

<p>This will give me the freedom to run my business from anywhere in country. Hell, anywhere in the world. This is <strong>huge</strong> not as a business goal, but as a goal for living a happy life.</p>

<h4>A Through Post Mortem</h4>

<p>What have I done right? What I have done wrong? Having all this time gives me an opportunity to look at every part of my business, from marketing, to sales, to deliverables, and see what has gone well, and what hasn&#8217;t. I&#8217;m taking all this free time I have and applying to finding ways to deliver better service and more value to my clients, while building a more sustainable business for myself.</p>

<h4>A Learning Experience</h4>

<p>I have been working on a book this year entitled <em>Professional Freelance</em>. I planned on including chapters on sales and marketing. By having a challenge that many other freelancers face every day gives me an chance to find ways to approach it, learn and invent new solutions, and gather knowledge that I can share with other people and help other people grow their career.</p>

<h3>The Struggle Isn&#8217;t Real</h3>

<p>When facing hardships, it&#8217;s good to be reminded that they aren&#8217;t as bad as they first seem, if we approach them in the correct fashion. What did Edison do after his watched his plant burn to the ground in a spectacular fashion? He got a loan from his friend Henry Ford, and in three weeks he was up and running again. Edison went on to make $10 million dollars in revenue that year (~$200 million in 2014 dollars).</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll leave you with a video on Stoic Optimism, a TEDx talk by Ryan Holiday:</p>

<p><img src="http://glennstovall.com/images/articles/simple_long.jpg"></p>

<p>In design, I&#8217;ve always been a fan of minimalism. Minimalism is a philosophy about boiling things down to their essential elements. It&#8217;s about having a philosophy of &#8220;less but better&#8221;. Great thinkers from all walks of life have touted the benefits of this kind of approach:</p>

<blockquote><p>Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication</p><footer><strong>Leonard Da Vinci</strong></footer></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.</p><footer><strong>Albert Einstein</strong></footer></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>Simplicity is the final achievement. After one has played a vast quantity of notes and more notes, it is simplicity that emerges as the crowning reward of art.</p><footer><strong>Fredric Chopin</strong></footer></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius – and a lot of courage – to move in the opposite direction.</p><footer><strong>E.F. Schumacher</strong></footer></blockquote>




<blockquote><p>Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it&#8217;s worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.</p><footer><strong>Steve Jobs</strong></footer></blockquote>


<p>There is a universal truth that drives all of these musicians, artists, and visionaries. They all speak of the beauty and elegance of simplicity in all things. As entrepreneurs, we have the power to design not only our businesses, but our entire lives. However, many people end up working long hours, taking on lots of stress, and doing physical and mental harm to ourselves.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>My Email Marketing Strategy In a Nutshell</h3>

<p>Email marketing converts better than social media or content marketing. Nathan Barry has a great <a href="http://nathanbarry.com/email-marketing/">write up with the numbers</a>. You can build a list by <a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/08/04/start-using-drip-email-campaigns-today/">giving people  incentives in exchange for their email address</a>, reaching out to them directly, or offering people updates on as-yet-unreleased new product. But once you have built that list, how do you write emails that people on that list will actually want to read?</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>Drop The Newsletters and start writing emails</h3>

<p>Newsletters are usually ignored and end up right in the trash bin.  Instead of thinking of your emails to your list as newsletters, I want you to approach them like you would writing an email to one person. When I write email drafts, I will usually start with the line &#8216;Hey Bob,&#8217;, where Bob is a real person I know. If I write with a more personal tone in mind, it will show in the final result. Your formatting needs to match this more personal tone, so no more fancy email themes..</p>

<h3>7 Steps to Formatting Your Email</h3>

<h4>1.Remove all formatting.</h4>

<p>Your email should look just like you sent it from your GMail or Mailbox account. This means that you don&#8217;t want any of the formatting that  email list providers offer. However, you don&#8217;t want to send a plain text email either. Plain text takes away some key formatting tools, such as <strong>bolding</strong>, <em>italicizing</em>, and <a href="#">putting in links</a>.</p>

<h4>2. Write your subject line like you would a regular email.</h4>

<p>Don&#8217;t title case your headline. Capitalize the first word, and then write the rest lowercase. Using questions in your subject line is a good way to increase open rates, but can become annoying if over used.</p>

<h4>3.Set the From Address to Your Address, and Encourage Replies.</h4>

<p>Emails are conversations, and conversations are a two-way street. The from address should be from your personal address if possible, and if not, one that you check and respond too frequently. Your subscribers should be able to reply to any of your emails and expect a response (it may not be obvious this is the case since the email is automated).</p>

<h4>4.Start with a salutation.</h4>

<p>If possible, capture the first name of people when they sign up for your list. This will allow you to start with a line like &#8216;Hey [first_name]&#8217;. A person&#8217;s name is their favorite word to hear, and it starts your email off on the right foot.</p>

<h4>5.Write short body copy.</h4>

<p>Some people like to send out entire articles in their email list. Personally, I don&#8217;t like this approach and haven&#8217;t had much success. If I have a lot to say, I will publish a larger article elsewhere, and include a short description in the email. I like to provide something extra to my subscribers, so I will usually provide additional examples or a personal story in the email.</p>

<h4>6.End with a friendly signature.</h4>

<p>I always sign my emails with &#8220;cheers, Glenn&#8221;. Much like the salutation, This gives the letter a more personal feel.</p>

<h4>7.Often, but not always, include a PS.</h4>

<p>The post script is one of the most read part of the email, after the subject line and the first paragraph. Even if people don&#8217;t want to read the rest of your email, they will check out the PS. In old letter writing, the &#8216;PS&#8217; was where people would include something <em>so good</em> that they just couldn&#8217;t leave it out. Your PS should only be a couple sentences long, and get straight to the point.</p>

<h3>The 3 Types of Emails to Send</h3>

<p>When writing emails to your list, there are three formats that I use:</p>

<h4>1.The Value Email.</h4>

<p>This email has no ulterior motive. This is simply an email that provides value to your list. You can provide value by offering something educational, useful, or entertaining to your list. <strong>you do not sell to your list.</strong> If someone was nice enough to sign up for your list, they deserve value from you in return. This is where you give it to them.</p>

<h4>2.The Soft Sell Email.</h4>

<p>The soft sell email is identical to the value email, with one small difference: You mention something you are selling as a secondary point in the email. The PS is a great place to do this. You can write a valuable article, then in the PS include a call to action. Now when I say &#8220;sale&#8221;, I don&#8217;t always mean that you are asking the people on your list to give you money in exchange for goods or services. A &#8220;sale&#8221; is anytime you are asking them to give up something of value in exchange for something of equal or greater value. When people sign up for your list, that was a sale. They exchanged access to their inbox for valuable information. In addition to selling products, you could ask them to sign up for a free trial, ask them a question, or ask them to attend an event such as a webinar.</p>

<h4>3.The Hard Sell Email.</h4>

<p>These emails have one goal: To get your users to buy something you are selling. Like the soft sell email, that sale could be anything from a transaction to a webinar sign-up. Use these <strong>sparingly</strong>.</p>

<h3>The Frequency of Emails</h3>

<p>I send out emails once a week, sometimes every two weeks. If you email your list more frequently than that, they may become fatigued. Some people push their list harder, and this is something that depends on your audience.</p>

<p>The only time I break this rule is when I am launching a new product or have an upcoming event. I will ramp up the emails to build anticipation for the event, and usually send reminders a week before, a day before, and even an hour before.</p>

<p>When it comes to email frequency, you should also be mindful of the frequency you use the three templates above. The hard sell email is OK sometimes, but if that is all you send, you will not keep your subscribers for long. My general rule of thumb is to keep a 2:1 ratio for helpful, valuable emails, and sales emails. Here is a 6-email rotation I tend to use:</p>

<ul>
<li>Value email</li>
<li>Value email</li>
<li>Soft sell email</li>
<li>Value email</li>
<li>Value email</li>
<li>Hard sell email</li>
</ul>


<p>That way, once I have gotten to the point where I am selling someone, I have already provided them a lot of value. This also means that I am only sending out sales emails once every 5 - 6 weeks. It may seem odd to spend a lot of time building a list and then sell to it so infrequently, but by taking this approach those sales emails are much more likely to get responses.</p>

<h3>Segment Your List As Much As Possible</h3>

<p>So far, all of this has been about making your emails more personalized. Doesn&#8217;t it seem strange to be more &#8216;personal&#8217;, and then send the same email to your entire list? It&#8217;s true, and one way to get around this is <em>segmentation.</em> Segmentation means that you break your list up based on past behavior, and sent broadcasts to smaller segments of your list. For example, if you are selling a certain product, it doesn&#8217;t make sense to keep sending emails to those people asking them to buy that product. Instead, you could only send them valuable emails, ask them for feedback on the product, or sell them something else.</p>

<h3>Email Tools that Provide Segmentation</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.convertkit.com">ConvertKit</a>.</strong> I&#8217;ve mentioned ConvertKit before, as it is the email tool I currently use. They recently revamped their segmenting, and allow you to segment on users based on which email capture form they signed up for.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.getdrip.com">Drip</a>.</strong> Drip has moved from being an email list management tool to a full on marketing automation tool. They provide user tagging, and a lot of triggers that you can use to segment your audience.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.mailchimp.com">MailChimp</a>.</strong> Mailchimp recently released a whole new <a href="http://mailchimp.com/features/automation/">suite of automation tools</a>. These are new and I haven&#8217;t tried them yet, but it looks promising. MailChimp is what a lot of people use already, so if this is you, you have a whole new set of toys to play with.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.infusionsoft.com">InfusionSoft</a>.</strong> InfusionSoft is the most powerful and most complex tool ons the market. They have a large start up cost (in the 4 figures), but they have a lot of tools and integration they make them the most in-depth marketing automation system out there.</li>
</ul>


<p>This is my entire email marketing strategy in a nutshell. By following these formulas, you can keep your list more engaged, and build a strong audience that is invested in you and your brand.</p>

    <id>http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/09/05/niche-blogging</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Personal vs. Professional Blogging part III</h3>

<p>Should you write under your personal name, or under a company brand? I&#8217;ve addressed this question in other articles. At first, I planned on starting two blogs (<a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/03/05/personal-blogging-vs-professional-blogging/">part I</a>). I tried that for a while and realized that I was spending a lot of time trying to build two audiences when I could just be building one. The time invested was not paying off. So, I decided to combine my two blogs, and write everything under my personal name (<a href="http://glennstovall.com/blog/2014/07/29/why-i-am-killing-my-company-blog/">part II</a>). Today I&#8217;m covering a third option: Instead of writing under your name or your company, you write about a particular subject on a niche blog.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>Niche Blogging</h3>

<p>A niche blog is a blog that is centered around a certain  topic, instead of around you or your company. The goal of a niche blog is to educate and inform its audience. For example, if your potential customers ran a SaaS business, you would have a site that was dedicated to writing articles to help SaaS owners.</p>

<h3>Using Niches to Sell Products</h3>

<p>Brennan Dunn recently made a shift to writing a subject focused site instead of a personal or company one. Over the past couple years, Brennan had a podcast which lived on his personal domain <a href="http://brennandunn.com">brennandunn.com</a>. Whenever he wrote an article, he would publish it on the blog of his software product, <a href="http://www.planscope.io">Planscope</a>.</p>

<p>Brennan recently decided to change how he was publishing content. He created a new site <a href="http://doubleyourfreelancing.com">doubleyourfreelancing.com</a>, and moved all of his content over to that site. His content is based around selling to freelancers, and this site is all about growing your freelancing business. He got the name from one of his most popular products, <em>Double Your Freelancing Rate</em>.</p>

<h3>Using Niche Writing to Get Clients</h3>

<p>By building a site around a certain subject, you position yourself as an authority in that subject. A friend of mine, Denny Cave, works exclusively on the LightCMS platform. He has a site called <a href="http://www.lightignite.com">LightIgnite</a> , which is all about developing on the LightCMS platform. By doing this, he puts himself in the position of being <strong>THE</strong> LightCMS guy, and this brings him a lot of client work.</p>

<h3>Are You Changing Your Blogging Strategy Again?</h3>

<p>No. This time, I&#8217;m not changing how I am doing anything, But I think that this is a strategy worth talking about, and worth considering if you are looking for a new way to publish your content, grow an audience, and make more sales.</p>

<p>In web development, the group of software, frameworks, and tools is called our &#8220;stack&#8221;. In businesses, you have a similar &#8220;stack&#8221;, which is made up of the tools and systems that you use to run your business. Today I wanted to list out my personal stack that I use.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Sales and Lead Management: PipeDrive</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.pipedrive.com/en/features/lead-tracking-software">Pipedrive</a> has the best visualization of the sales pipeline I have seen, and it can be completely customized. But the most valuable feature is that every time you finish a task that is related to a deal, it will automatically prompt you to create another. This way you never forget to follow up with a potential client, and deals don&#8217;t fall through the cracks. This is great way to keep track of your leads.</p>

<h2>Contracts: Docracy</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.docracy.com">Docracy</a> is a free resource for open source contract templates. It also has e-signatures, so you can use it to get contracts signed with remote clients. Here a couple of templates that I either use, or have my own modified version of:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.docracy.com/649dkpe7g9/contract-killer-3">General Work Contract</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.docracy.com/0i2fahvpv5t/statement-of-work-digital-advertising-services">Statement of Work</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.docracy.com/27/generic-shortform-nda">Generic Short Form NDA</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>Invoicing: FreshBooks</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.freshbooks.com">Freshbooks</a> is one of the largest invoicing tools out there. It makes generating invoices simple. Freshbooks is great if you bill by the hour, however since I moving away from that billing structure I have found Freshbooks to be a bit lacking. It doesn&#8217;t really have support for daily and weekly billing. But it does have simple time tracking, expense tracking, online payments, and really good reporting. I do appreciate that when tax time rolls around, I can print out a couple reports, hand them to my CPA, and boom. Done.</p>

<h2>Customer Support: ZenDesk</h2>

<p>When I was looking for a customer support tool, my one requirement was that it had to work 100% via email for clients. Clients are busy and don&#8217;t want to have to learn a new tool just because they found a bug. <a href="http://zendesk.com">Zendesk</a> met this requirement. My clients can send all inquiries to a support email address, and I can keep track of conversations and tickets via the application. When working with clients on monthly retainers, this is a great tool to keep things organized.</p>

<h2>Scheduling: Calendly + Google Calendar</h2>

<p>I hate having to go back and forth via email to schedule an appointment with someone. With <a href="http://www.calendly.com">Calendly</a>, I can send people a calendar of my availability, and they can select the time that works best for them. The real &#8220;killer feature&#8221; for me is the Google calendar integration: Not only does it add events to my calendar, it will automatically remove my availability if I schedule something else in that time slot, even if it wasn&#8217;t through Calendly.</p>

<h2>Writing Articles: Draft</h2>

<p><a href="https://draftin.com/">Draft</a> is a new tool I&#8217;ve started using recently. I love the clean interface and how easy it is to share drafts with people. I&#8217;ve been using to send some beta versions of chapters for my book project <em>Professional Freelance</em>. It also has a &#8216;Hemingway mode&#8217;, which disables the backspace and delete buttons for you. This makes the writing experience similar to writing on a typewriter, which is helpful when writing first drafts, and keeps you out of slipping into editing mode.</p>

<h2>Writing Books &amp; Courses: Scrivener</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php">Scrivener</a> is like Photoshop for words. It allows you to break your writing project in nested sections, and move them around freely. This way, moving chapters and sections around are easy. When I first began to attempt to write a book, I figured I would write an outline, and then fill it out. As the project went on, I&#8217;ve completely rearranged the books three times. Sometimes entire chapters are deleted, and whole new ones are added. Scrivener makes this process a breeze.</p>

<h2>Publishing: OctoPress + WordPress + Medium</h2>

<p>I have a few different tools that I use to publish content online:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> Octopress is the site you are reading right now. It&#8217;s a static site generator. That means that instead of having software like WordPress installed on a server, I generate the pages on my local machine, and put the result online. This way, there are no load times, and no worry of hacking because there is nothing to hack.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> WordPress is the granddaddy of online publishing, and I use it for my company site <a href="http://www.concordantsolutions.com">Concordant Solutions</a>. WordPress can be a bit unwieldy at times, but it does make publishing simple, and it&#8217;s impossible to beat the ecosystem around it. All of the plugins and themes available make it easy to get something set up quickly.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://medium.com">Medium</a> is a very slick looking online publishing platform. It was created by Ev Williams, one of the founders of Twitter. Medium is focused on longer form content and providing the best reading and writing experience for its users. The benefit of Medium is that it helps you reach out to new audiences. When I&#8217;m not writing here, I&#8217;m writing there. In fact, I am considering moving more of my writing over to Medium in the future.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Email Marketing: ConvertKit</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.convertkit.com">ConvertKit</a> is responsible for all those little calls to action at the bottom of each post. ConvertKit has a different approach from other mailing list providers. Instead of just putting everyone onto one list, you create different forms. These forms usually come with an incentive, such as a download or a course. Then, you can segment users based on which form they signed up for. This allows you to send more targeted emails.</p>

<p>In addition to forms that you can embed, ConvertKit also allows you to build landing pages which can then be embedded on your site. I also like the simple look of the emails. I hate the idea of &#8220;newsletters&#8221;. I view my list as communication at scale. ConvertKit is just an easy way to email a few hundred people and start some conversations. All the emails come from my email address so that you can hit &#8220;reply&#8221; to get in touch with me. And I always write back. If you want to see what one of their landing pages looks like and/or sign up for my list, <a href="https://app.convertkit.com/concordant/letters">Here is the link</a></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Come Ship More Content in September With Me</h3>

<p>I heard about this challenge that a friend of a friend is doing: blog every weekday for 30 days. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://cdevroe.com/blog/9527/blogging-every-weekday-for-30-days">the original post</a>. Here&#8217;s the post where I <a href="http://mattdsmith.com/30-day-blog-challenge/">heard about it</a>. I know writing is a valuable skill. Blogging can help you build your reach, prove your authority, and give you an way to provide value to your potential clients and customers by providing them with educational content.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>However, I want to modify this challenge a bit, just because I kind of hate the term &#8220;blogging&#8221;. Blogging is just one way to deliver content, there are several others. Instead, I want to take on the &#8220;30-day publishing challenge&#8221;. Under my rules, any of the following will count as my writing for the day:</p>

<h3>What Counts</h3>

<ul>
<li>Publishing a new blog post. This includes my personal site or sites such as Medium.</li>
<li>Publishing a new letter to people on my mailing list (yep, this is my Day 1)</li>
<li>Publishing a new page or re-writing an existing page on my personal or company site.</li>
<li>Publishing another form of long-form content, such as an email course, eBook, or PDF.
Here are things that don&#8217;t count:</li>
</ul>


<h3>What Doesn&#8217;t Count</h3>

<ul>
<li>Republishing existing content in a new form (I&#8217;ve been looking into using Quora&#8217;s and LinkedIn&#8217;s publishing platforms to get more reach)</li>
<li>Super short-form content (tweets, tumbles, facebook posts, etc.)</li>
</ul>


<p>Since I&#8217;m bending the rules a bit, I&#8217;m going to publish something every 30 days instead of just on weekdays. This also means that for the weekends I&#8217;ll probably write three things on Friday and space them out over the weekend.</p>

<p>So you up to taking the challenge? If  <a href="http://www.glennstovall.com/contact">drop me a line</a>. I&#8217;d love to follow along with what you are doing.</p>
