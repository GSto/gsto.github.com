  <p>As a freelancer, I write a lot of proposals. Sometimes they close sales, sometimes they don&#8217;t. One of the problems with proposals is that they live in a black box. You write your proposal, send it to a client, and wait for a response.</p>

<p>The problem with this is that you rarely get feedback from our clients, and we rarely get a chance to see the work of other freelancers. Developers have open source code, and designers freely share their work on Dribbble. We all know that transparency and helping each other out makes all of us better, so why don&#8217;t we take that approach to our sales process?</p>

<h2>Stop Writing Proposals Alone</h2>

<p>I&#8217;m working on a system to allow freelancers to help each other write better proposals and more accurate estimates. With this system, you will be able to submit your work anonymously, and get feedback from other freelancers. With this system, you&#8217;ll hear from your peers on how you can improve your process. Or you can submit past proposals that didn&#8217;t close, and learn from your mistakes.</p>

<h2>Start Learning From Your Peers While Helping The Community</h2>

<p>Freelancers are usually tight lipped with their proposals. When you volunteer to review proposals, you are getting an inside look at the sales techniques of other proposals and agencies. You help them with feedback, and learn something in the process.</p>

<h2>I&#8217;m Looking For A Group of Freelancers To Get The Ball Rolling. Are You In?</h2>

<p>I know that starting online communities can be challenging. For that reason, I am looking for a select group of freelancers for the first beta release of the product. Enter your information if you are interesting in applying below. I&#8217;ll be touch directly. I won&#8217;t be letting just <em>anyone</em> in at first, in order to make sure that you are getting quality feedback, and your proposals don&#8217;t turn into the comments section of YouTube.</p>
