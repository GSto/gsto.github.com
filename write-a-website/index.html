  <p>
When I&#8217;ve worked with clients in the past, I&#8217;d ask them to send me the content for their site. It&#8217;s better for people to write about their own businesses, because it is such an important piece of the image your business communicates. Besides, the best content comes from the heart, and no one love your business like you do. But this approach causes some problems, and I would get this question a lot:
</p>


<h2> But HOW Do I Write Content?</h2>
<p>
  You don&#8217;t know how many pages your site needs, or how much you should write for each of them. Sure it needs a home page, but what should go there, what shouldn&#8217;t? How much do you need to write? Maybe you don&#8217;t think you have the creativity or the time to write. Fortunately, writing for the web does not take a whole lot of either.
</p>

<p>
  Writing is mostly knowing your customer, knowing your business, and knowing <em>why</em> you are writing in the first place.  
</p>

<h2>Web Content Has to Have a Purpose</h2>

<p>
  Your website should have a goal. That goal could be getting visitors to join a newsletter, purchase a product, sign up for a service, or come to your brick and mortar location. No matter what the goal is, copy can help your visitors get there. You don&#8217;t want to write words that just take up space on the page. There is <strong>more</strong> than enough of that on the internet already. You want to write content that has a positive impact on your business and provides value to your visitors. That&#8217;s what this course is all about. 
</p>
