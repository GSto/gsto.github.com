  <p>Hey there,</p>

<p>Building a software as a service product is a tried and true way to build recurring revenue, but building the product itself is difficult. Until you have paying customers, you have to manage the limited time and resources you have effectively.</p>

<p>In order to be competitive, you need to be listening to your customers and solving their problems. No one has signed up for a service because it had a great authentication system or billing code, but these features are the backbone of a good software product.</p>

<h2>If you can&#8217;t take payment securely and reliably, you can&#8217;t make money. Period.</h2>

<p>If you invest a lot of time and money into getting these set up, that&#8217;s time and money you spend working on the things your customers <em>actually</em> care about. If you don&#8217;t, you risk not being able to have a product at all.</p>

<h2>And you want to focus on the new problems. That&#8217;s what&#8217;ll get people in the door.</h2>

<p>These aren&#8217;t new problems. You aren&#8217;t the first person that wants to let users log in or pay you once a month for your service.</p>

<p>As such, there are tried and tested methods for handling these problems. And I want to take them off your plate you can stay focused on the big picture.</p>

<h2>SaaS Kickstart: Your Battle-tested Payment and authentication system.</h2>

<p>For the Saas Kickstart, you&#8217;ll get everything listed below, at one flat rate:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Stripe Integration &#8211;</strong> Stripe is hands down the most powerful tool for accepting and managing online payments. I&#8217;ll get you set up with an account and integrate it into your product.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Plans &amp; Pricing &#8211; </strong> You&#8217;ll get a high-converting landing page template integrated with multiple payment pricing plans. These can be monthly or annual plans, or both.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bulletproof Authentication &#8211;</strong> Users will be able to create accounts, update plans, and cancel accounts. You won&#8217;t have to worry about account management at all.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>A Scalable, Secure Server Deployment &#8211;</strong> I&#8217;ll deploy the application to a pre-approved hosting provider, and configure a domain and SSL certificate so your customers&#8217; data will be secure.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Analytics Integration &#8211; </strong> Your system will integrated with one of a number of analytics systems, so that as your app grows you will be able to track user behavior, and make informed decisions about design, copy, and feature development.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>An Environment Your Developers Will Love &#8211;</strong> Your application will come with documentation for both the project manager and developers, so that adding features is easy and fun.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Plays Nice With Phones and Google &#8211;</strong> All the code is optimized for search engines, social media, and smartphones.</p></li>
</ul>
